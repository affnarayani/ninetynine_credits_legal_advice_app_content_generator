    "title": "Justice in Time: Allahabad High Court Orders Six-Month Limit on Maintenance Cases",
    "description": "<p>The Allahabad High Court, in *Smt. Anjali Singh vs. State of U.P. and Another*, has directed the Family Court, Gautam Budh Nagar, to conclude a pending maintenance case within six months, emphasizing the urgency of financial relief for deserted wives under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. Justice Nalin Kumar Srivastava stressed the need for swift resolution in such cases, given the economic hardship faced by abandoned women, and underscored the responsibility of all actors in the justice system to avoid unnecessary delays.</p>\n\n<p>Maintenance under Indian law, primarily through Section 125 Cr.P.C., ensures financial support to spouses, minor children, or dependent parents unable to support themselves, irrespective of religion. To claim maintenance, a wife must demonstrate her husband's sufficient means and refusal to provide support; \"wife\" includes legally wedded and, in some cases, divorced, non-remarried women. Besides the Cr.P.C., maintenance claims can also be pursued under personal laws and special legislation like the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and the Domestic Violence Act.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Anjali Singh, who filed a maintenance case in the Family Court of Gautam Budh Nagar, contending that her husband's delaying tactics prolonged the proceedings. Her counsel argued that the repeated adjournments amounted to judicial harassment, as she had no independent source of income and depended on the litigation's outcome.</p>\n\n<p>The Court observed that Section 125 Cr.P.C. cases directly concern the dignity and well-being of vulnerable women and children and should be handled with compassion and urgency. It emphasized that delays in maintenance matters deny justice and amplify the emotional and financial distress of women. The Family Court was directed to decide the case within six months, granting no unnecessary adjournments, conditional on the applicant's full cooperation.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends in Indian maintenance law reflect increased judicial recognition of women's financial insecurity post-separation or divorce. Courts are increasingly setting time limits for resolution, proactively issuing interim maintenance orders, and using measures like salary attachment to ensure enforcement. Courts have also clarified that women can pursue maintenance under multiple legal frameworks simultaneously, provided there is no double recovery.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment matters because it recognizes that maintenance litigation is about restoring dignity and fairness, mandating a six-month deadline to aid similarly situated women nationwide. It broadens judicial responsibility to include all stakeholders, acknowledging that prolonged procedures can further victimize already suffering parties and promoting judicial accountability in family law litigation.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court acquitted all twelve accused in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts case on July 21, 2025, reversing a 2015 trial court conviction. The ruling, delivered nearly two decades after the attacks that killed 189 and injured over 820, cited severe evidentiary and procedural flaws in the prosecution's case.</p>\n\n<p>The court found that the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had \"utterly failed\" to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Key issues included unreliable witness testimony and questionable investigative procedures. The High Court emphasized that guilt must be proven unequivocally, even in terror cases, and that coerced confessions and procedural lapses are unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>The acquittal raises significant questions about the ATS's investigative methods and the potential wrongful imprisonment of innocent individuals for nearly two decades. The State of Maharashtra is expected to appeal the judgment in the Supreme Court. The case highlights the urgent need for police reforms, independent review of terror investigations, and accountability mechanisms to prevent wrongful prosecutions, particularly where allegations of torture are involved. The judgment underscores the importance of upholding the rule of law, even when public sentiment presumes guilt.</p>",

    "title": "No Fresh Notice to Heirs Needed after Section 13(2), SARFAESI Served: Srinagar Bench Clarifies",
    "description": "<p>The Srinagar Bench of the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh recently addressed a case regarding the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002, specifically concerning the necessity of issuing a fresh Section 13(2) notice to the legal heirs of a deceased borrower. The case arose after Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd. initiated proceedings under Section 14 of the Act to take possession of a mortgaged property following the death of the borrower, Abdul Aziz Sofi, after a Section 13(2) notice had already been served to him during his lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>The legal heirs challenged the bank's action, arguing that a fresh Section 13(2) notice should have been issued to them, asserting that the proceedings violated principles of natural justice. The bank countered that Section 14 is a summary remedy focused on the secured asset and not a personal action against the borrower, emphasizing that the initial Section 13(2) notice was validly served.</p>\n\n<p>The Court ruled in favor of the bank, dismissing the writ petition. It clarified that the death of the borrower does not extinguish the bank's right to proceed against the mortgaged property, as the liability transfers to the estate. The Court emphasized that Section 14's provisos only require affirmation of compliance with Section 13(2) as it stood during the borrower's lifetime and do not mandate a second round of notices to the successors. While dismissing the petition, the judges added that the bank would consider any One-Time Settlement scheme application by the petitioners. The ruling underscores that SARFAESI focuses on the secured asset rather than the borrower's continued existence.</p>",

Manoj Saha & Anr.*, reversed a Calcutta High Court order, reaffirming the primacy of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI Act), 2002. The case involved a tenant who failed to adequately demonstrate a pre-existing, protected tenancy prior to a property's mortgage and subsequent action under SARFAESI.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose when PNB Housing Finance initiated SARFAESI proceedings against a borrower who had mortgaged the property. A tenant on the property asserted rights under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997, after the bank took possession. The High Court initially restored possession to the tenant, but the Supreme Court overturned this decision.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized that the 2016 amendment to SARFAESI provides a complete code, requiring tenants aggrieved by Section 13(4) measures to apply to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under Section 17(4A), and if necessary, appeal to the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal. The Court found that the tenant's evidence of continuous possession prior to the Section 13(2) notice was lacking. The court also cited *Bajarang Shyamsunder Agarwal*, clarifying protections for tenants under oral or unregistered agreements are limited to one year from the Section 13(2) notice.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling reinforces the statutory framework of SARFAESI, highlighting that High Court intervention under Article 227 is inappropriate when an effective statutory remedy exists. The Supreme Court directed the DRT to promptly resolve the pending application, confirming PNB Housing Finance's possession of the secured asset and underscoring the importance of adhering to the established SARFAESI process.</p>",

These amendments, finalized after extensive stakeholder consultation following the draft publication on October 31, 2022, are issued under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.</p>\n\n<p>Key technical changes include updated refractive index values for certain food products to enhance analytical precision in quality assessment. A new standard for meat sausages has been introduced, defining classifications, compositional criteria, and preparation processes, aiming to ensure uniformity and consumer safety.

This directive signifies a commitment to stricter promoter verification and legal enforceability. The order invokes Regulation 4(1)(B)(i) of the Rajasthan Real Estate Regulatory Authority (General) Regulations, 2017, requiring submission of identity and registration certificates relevant to the promoter's legal status.</p>\n\n<p>This new requirement necessitates that promoters seeking to register projects in Rajasthan under a partnership or LLP must ensure their partnership deeds or LLP agreements are duly registered with the relevant Registrar of Firms or Registrar of Companies. Non-compliance can lead to rejection or delay of project registration applications.</p>\n\n<p>The rationale behind this directive includes enhancing legal certainty, facilitating enforceability, and ensuring greater promoter accountability. While most State RERAs require submission of partnership or LLP deeds, Rajasthan uniquely demands registered deeds as a precondition for project registration, setting a new compliance benchmark.

The case arose from IOCL's decision to halt kerosene supplies to M/s Shree Niwas Ramgopal, a partnership firm, following the death of one of its partners, citing a rigid interpretation of its internal guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>The court emphasized that Section 42 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, regarding dissolution upon a partner's death, primarily applies to two-partner firms, especially when the partnership deed explicitly states continuity is maintained. The court found IOCL's actions arbitrary and in violation of Article 14, as they disregarded the partnership deed's provisions and imposed unreasonable demands on the firm to include all of the deceased's heirs, despite internal disputes.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court upheld the Calcutta High Court's mandamus, directing IOCL to resume kerosene supplies. This decision reinforces the supremacy of partnership agreements and mandates a more pragmatic, fair approach from state entities when dealing with their commercial partners, favoring business continuity over bureaucratic inflexibility.

The authority letter provided by Ankur Aggarwal was deemed invalid as it was issued after the legal notice was sent and the complaint filed, and was not a valid power of attorney. Furthermore, as the cheque was issued to Shirgul Filling Station, and Ankur Aggarwal failed to prove the proprietorship, he could not be considered the \"payee\" as required by Section 138.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed the Trial Court's decision, dismissing the criminal appeal and upholding the acquittal of Kamal Sharma. The judgment underscores the importance of adhering to procedural requirements, establishing clear locus standi with valid authorization, and ensuring authorization timeliness.

This decision reinforces the protection afforded by the Consumer Protection Act, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the MRP displayed on product packaging.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when a consumer, Lenish V.R., was charged Rs. 800 for a brandy bottle with an MRP of Rs. 740 at a Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) outlet. Despite KSBC acknowledging the overcharge, they failed to provide evidence justifying the additional amount. The Commission found that the consumer successfully demonstrated the violation, shifting the burden of proof to KSBC, which they could not fulfill.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission emphasized that as per the Legal Metrology Act, 2009, and the Packaged Commodities Rules, 2011, retailers are prohibited from selling pre-packaged commodities above the MRP, except in cases of valid tax revisions within a specific timeframe, which KSBC could not prove. The Commission also noted that, as a government-owned entity, KSBC has a responsibility to act as a model vendor, upholding consumer rights and statutory norms without exception.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission directed KSBC to refund the excess amount of Rs. 60, provide Rs. 5,000 in compensation for mental distress, and cover Rs. 10,000 in litigation costs, all with interest. Additionally, KSBC was instructed to immediately cease the practice of overcharging for pre-packaged commodities.

Initially, the FIR was registered under Sections 306 and 498A IPC, and later Section 304B was added, but the trial court acquitted the accused due to lack of evidence.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed the acquittal, clarifying that not every post-marital demand qualifies as \"dowry\" under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The court reasoned that the demand for bail money was a post-marital financial dispute, not a dowry demand made \"in connection with the marriage.\" However, the court also cautioned that while the demand didn't constitute dowry, the conduct could still amount to \"cruelty\" under Section 498A or abetment to suicide under Section 306, provided sufficient evidence exists. The court's decision was based on unproven medical causes of death, a lack of credible evidence of financial harassment, and accused having sufficient funds that contradicted the prosecution's narrative.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment underscores the importance of prosecutors carefully framing charges, gathering reliable evidence, and distinguishing between dowry-linked demands and other forms of oppressive conduct. While the decision is legally sound regarding Section 304B, it should not diminish the seriousness of non-dowry related cruelty, which remains actionable under other IPC provisions.</p>",

This concession, deemed necessary in the public interest, covers the remaining 50% of the stamp duty for the initial conveyance related to 1217.71 acres of land parcels explicitly identified in the joint venture agreement and approved under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966. The conditions outlined in the June 20, 2023, order remain applicable.</p>\n\n<p>This complete stamp duty remission provides a significant financial incentive for large-scale integrated township projects by eliminating a substantial transaction cost. It is anticipated to accelerate development, attract greater investment in urban infrastructure, and contribute to meeting the growing demand for well-planned residential, commercial, and recreational spaces in the MMR. Stakeholders should carefully review the details of this order, in conjunction with the stipulations of the June 20, 2023, order, to maximize its benefits.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India upheld the Karnataka High Court's decision, reinforcing the principle that the legal heirs of a person who dies due to their own negligent driving cannot claim compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The case, *G Nagarathna & Ors. vs. G Manjunatha & Anr.*, stems from a fatal accident where the driver's excessive speed and traffic violations led to his death. His family's claim for compensation was rejected by both the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal and the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court, in dismissing the family's appeal, affirmed the established tort law principle that individuals cannot benefit from their own wrongdoing. The Court reasoned that a borrower of a vehicle assumes the responsibilities and risks of ownership, including the duty to drive safely. Awarding compensation in such cases would contradict fundamental tort principles and public policy.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling clarifies that while the legal heirs of a negligent driver cannot claim compensation for the driver\u2019s death, valid claims made by third parties injured due to the deceased\u2019s negligence remain actionable under the Motor Vehicles Act. The decision discourages reckless driving and safeguards the integrity of the insurance system by preventing individuals from profiting from their own negligent acts. It ensures that the compensation framework isn't an unintended incentive for unlawful behavior on the roads, and reinforces accountability under the Motor Vehicles Act.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Chhattisgarh High Court, in *Satyendra Prakash Suryawanshi v. State of Chhattisgarh & Ors.*, clarified the scope of the UGC's dual degree policy, stating that students pursuing two degrees simultaneously cannot demand judicial intervention to reschedule examinations due to overlapping schedules. The court emphasized that while the NEP 2020 and associated UGC guidelines permit dual enrollment, the responsibility for managing conflicting schedules lies with the student.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a petitioner enrolled in both a Master of Social Work program and an LL.B. program, whose final examination schedules clashed. He argued that this infringed upon his fundamental right to education. However, the court rejected this argument, asserting that the right to education does not extend to compelling universities to adjust their administrative functions for individual benefit.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling reinforces that universities retain administrative autonomy and are not legally obligated to modify examination schedules for individual student's convenience. The judgment serves as a caution to students, highlighting the need for careful planning and management of multiple academic commitments when pursuing dual degrees under the UGC framework. The court underscored that it will not intervene in the day-to-day administration of academic institutions to accommodate personal convenience.</p>",

These amendments focus on bolstering transparency, accountability, and the handling of avoidance transactions within the corporate insolvency resolution process.</p>\n\n<p>A key change involves enhanced disclosure requirements for the Information Memorandum (IM). Resolution Professionals (RPs) are now obligated to include comprehensive details of identified avoidance transactions, fraudulent activities, or wrongful trading within the IM. This includes transactions potentially designed to defraud or unfairly disadvantage creditors. The RP must also keep the IM updated and provide it periodically to the Committee of Creditors (CoC), ensuring access to current and comprehensive information for informed decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the amendments address the treatment of disclosed transactions in the resolution plan, restricting the assignment of any avoidance transactions or fraudulent or wrongful trading.

The Court set aside an arbitral tribunal's interim order imposing personal deposit and disclosure obligations on Mr. Saravana Prasad, the sole shareholder of Innovative Film Academy Pvt. Ltd. (an OPC), reaffirming the principle of limited liability under Indian corporate law.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from a production agreement between Innovative and Endemol, resulting in \u20b910.40 crores in unpaid invoices. The arbitral tribunal's interim order, under Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, directed both Innovative and Mr. Prasad to deposit the disputed amount and disclose assets.</p>\n\n<p>The Court ruled that while requiring Innovative to secure the disputed amount was fair, extending this obligation to Mr. Prasad personally was unsustainable. It emphasized that an OPC is a distinct legal entity under Section 2(62) of the Companies Act, 2013, offering limited liability. Being a sole shareholder or director does not equate to personal liability absent contractual liability, fraud, or misuse. Imposing personal obligations on Mr. Prasad undermined the legislative intent behind OPCs.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court partially allowed the appeal, setting aside the personal obligations imposed on Mr. Prasad while upholding the requirements for Innovative. This ruling reaffirms corporate separateness and limited liability, protecting individual entrepreneurs in OPCs from personal financial exposure unless specific legal thresholds are met.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, in *Ritesh Haldar v. Elite Housing LLP*, ruled that redevelopment processes cannot circumvent legal eviction procedures for individuals in lawful possession, even without ownership. The case involved competing claims to a flat undergoing redevelopment, focusing on the intersection of matrimonial rights, property possession, and redevelopment logistics.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute centered on a flat being redeveloped by Elite Housing LLP, where Leena, the wife of one of the owner's brothers, resided with her children, claiming it as her matrimonial home. While she didn't claim ownership, she opposed the redevelopment without compensation and alternate accommodation. Ritesh, claiming ownership, sought to hand over the flat, viewing Leena as a gratuitous licensee.</p>\n\n<p>The court emphasized that redevelopment cannot replace formal eviction processes, reinforcing that Leena's eviction required a court decree. The court cited precedents highlighting that the person in actual possession at the time of redevelopment is entitled to transit rent and restoration of possession in the redeveloped property. While acknowledging Ritesh's ownership, the court directed the Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreement (PAAA) be executed in his name, and that he receive hardship compensation, but this did not affect Leena\u2019s possessory rights.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Court endorsed a dual-track approach, recognizing Ritesh\u2019s rights as legal owner for purposes of contractual execution and compensation, while protecting Leena\u2019s possessory rights during and after redevelopment. Leena will receive transit rent and possession of the redeveloped flat, subject to the outcome of an existing eviction suit. The ruling underscores the importance of lawful possession and due legal process in redevelopment projects, balancing ownership rights with possessory protection.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In a recent ruling, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) overturned a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) decision regarding an insolvency case between Mrs. Leena Salot (Riddhim Textiles) and Ridham Synthetics Private Limited. The case hinged on the interpretation of debt and the existence of pre-existing disputes under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC).</p>\n\n<p>Mrs. Salot filed a petition under Section 9 of the IBC to initiate the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against Ridham Synthetics for non-payment of an outstanding operational debt. The NCLT dismissed the petition, prompting Mrs. Salot to appeal to the NCLAT. Mrs. Salot argued that the outstanding amount was admitted by Ridham Synthetics in their ledger statements, through part payments and also contended that the Respondent had availed the benefit of Input Tax Credit under the CGST Act, 2017, indicating their acknowledgment of the invoices.</p>\n\n<p>Ridham Synthetics claimed that the invoices were for goods not delivered or of inferior quality. They cited a WhatsApp message as evidence of a pre-existing dispute regarding the quality of goods. They also contended that the Appellant had invoked arbitration, acknowledging the existence of pre-existing disputes, and thus the Section 9 petition was not maintainable.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT, referencing Section 9 of the IBC and the judgment in *Mobilox Innovations Pvt.

Prabhakaran*, reaffirmed that impleading petitions can be entertained at any stage before judgment, clarifying the application of Order I Rule 10(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) and the doctrine of lis pendens. This decision strengthens the rights of transferees pendente lite.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from a suit for specific performance where the defendant sold the property to P. Marimuthu during the suit's pendency. The trial court dismissed Marimuthu's impleading petition, arguing the suit was reserved for judgment. Marimuthu appealed, contending he was a bona fide purchaser entitled to be heard, while the plaintiff argued that the impleading application was belated and Marimuthu was bound by lis pendens.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court held that transfers pendente lite are subservient to the rights of parties in litigation under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. However, relying on Supreme Court precedent, the court emphasized that transferees pendente lite have a significant interest in defending their title and should generally be allowed to participate, especially when the original party may not properly contest the suit. The Court explicitly rejected the notion that impleading petitions are inadmissible once a matter is reserved for judgment, stating that \"at any stage of the proceedings\" in Order I Rule 10(2) CPC means any time before judgment pronouncement. The Court allowed the appeal and directed the trial court to accept the impleading application, permit cross-examination of the plaintiff, and allow formal evidence regarding the sale deed.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment reinforces the principle that procedural technicalities should not defeat substantial rights, particularly when collusion or prejudice to a transferee exists. It reminds transferees pendente lite that while lis pendens limits their rights, it does not extinguish them. Trial courts are reminded to exercise their power to implead parties under Order I Rule 10(2) CPC sensitively, even at advanced stages of proceedings. Ultimately, *P. Marimuthu v. S.S. Prabhakaran* reaffirms the judiciary's commitment to protecting bona fide purchasers and upholding justice by allowing impleading petitions before judgment, balancing the sanctity of litigation with preventing procedural injustice.</p>",
