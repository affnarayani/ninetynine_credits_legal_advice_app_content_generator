    "title": "Unauthorized Promotion And Promoter Liability Under RERA: \u201cComing Soon\u201d Is Still Advertising",
    "description": "<p>The Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), Bihar, imposed a penalty on M/s Alphabet Infra Pvt. Ltd. for advertising its \"One World, Brahmapura Railway Colony\" project prior to obtaining statutory registration, a direct contravention of Section 3(1) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. RERA initiated proceedings after promotional materials for the unregistered project appeared.</p>\n\n<p>The Authority affirmed that the Act\u2019s comprehensive definition of \"advertisement\" (Section 2(b)) includes all promotional efforts, such as \"Coming Soon\" displays, intended to solicit interest. It dismissed the respondent's defense that \"Alphapet Infra\" was merely a brand label, not the promoter, and that the signs were for identification. RERA clarified that liability under Section 3 applies to any entity involved in promoting an unregistered project, regardless of such distinctions.</p>\n\n<p>RERA underscored that project registration is a mandatory, threshold obligation to ensure transparency and consumer protection, which cannot be negated by claims of preliminary registration steps or subsequent remorse. Consequently, a penalty of \u20b91,00,000 was levied under Section 59(1). This ruling solidifies RERA's \"bright-line rule\" that no advertising or promotional activity is permissible before a project is duly registered, emphasizing the critical need for strict compliance from all real estate developers and their affiliates.</p>",

    "title": "IP Insights: How The DLI Scheme Is Shaping India\u2019s Semiconductor IP Ecosystem",
    "description": "<p>The Design Linked Incentive (DLI) Scheme, a key initiative under India's Semicon India Programme by MeitY, strategically aims to bolster the domestic semiconductor ecosystem by fostering the creation, ownership, and commercialization of indigenous Intellectual Property (IP). Recognizing semiconductor design as the most IP-intensive segment of the chip value chain, the DLI Scheme ensures that valuable IP generated with public support remains anchored within India, reducing reliance on foreign technologies and advancing technological sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>The scheme provides financial incentives, covering up to 50% of eligible design expenditure and 30% for product deployment, alongside crucial access to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and prototyping infrastructure. It is open to Indian startups, MSMEs, domestic companies, and research institutions. While beneficiaries retain IP ownership, the scheme mandates IP generation and patent filings within India, balancing private rights with national accountability.</p>\n\n<p>Since its launch in 2021, the DLI Scheme has shown significant progress. It has supported over 50 beneficiaries, leading to the development of 28 IPs/SoCs, over 100 patent filings, and more than 10 silicon tape-outs. Success stories include Vervesemi Microelectronics with its motor-control chips and 10 patents, InCore Semiconductors developing indigenous RISC-V processor IPs, Netrasemi's indigenously designed 12nm AI SoC, Aheesa Digital Innovations' fiber-broadband solutions, and AAGYAVISION's radar-on-chip solutions. These achievements demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in translating indigenous design capabilities into market-ready semiconductor products.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the DLI Scheme represents a strategic shift towards IP-led semiconductor growth. By lowering entry barriers and mitigating financial risks for innovators, it significantly contributes to India\u2019s objectives of technological self-reliance and enhanced competitiveness in the global semiconductor design landscape.</p>",

    "title": "From Builder Control to Resident Empowerment: The New Occupancy Certificate Framework",
    "description": "<p>The Maharashtra Government has enacted a significant reform, empowering housing societies to directly apply for Occupancy Certificates (OCs), addressing a critical issue where developers often failed to secure them. An OC is crucial for legal occupation, confirming a building's compliance with essential services. Historically, developers held exclusive rights to apply, frequently leading to misuse of power and leaving residents in Mumbai and MMR vulnerable to legal, financial, and redevelopment risks due to uncertified properties.</p>\n\n<p>Under the new initiative, over 25,000 buildings, including those under BMC, MHADA, and SRA, can now seek full or partial OCs, either jointly or independently. A six-month window offers penalty waivers for timely applications, though premiums apply for utilized additional FSI. This policy aims to simplify compliance for over 10 lakh residents by offering premium discounts and easing administrative hurdles. It fundamentally shifts control from developers to residents, acknowledging that many buildings are already occupied and tax-paying, while still upholding safety and structural integrity checks.</p>\n\n<p>This reform streamlines redevelopment for older properties, provides an alternative compliance route for projects outside RERA, and significantly boosts marketability and title certainty\u2014factors vital for lenders, buyers, and insurers. Although it doesn't imply legal amnesty and applications may be rejected for major non-compliances, it empowers societies to collectively resolve long-standing issues. The move is expected to enhance buyer confidence, mitigate conflicts, and ultimately elevate housing standards across Maharashtra, marking a pivotal step towards lawful regularization and seamless urban development.</p>",

    "title": "Financial Interest Is Not Consent: Limits on Impleading Non-Signatories in Arbitration",
    "description": "<p>The jurisprudence on impleading non-signatories in arbitration, especially post-Cox and Kings Ltd. v. SAP India Pvt. Ltd., emphasizes a balance between expanding arbitral jurisdiction and preventing its indiscriminate use. The Himachal Pradesh High Court, in Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi v. Central Public Works Department & Anr., reinforced that mere financial interest or project ownership does not constitute consent to arbitrate.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved IIT Mandi, which entered an MoU with CPWD for construction. CPWD then independently contracted a private contractor, with this contract containing an arbitration clause. When disputes arose between CPWD and the contractor, IIT Mandi sought impleadment in the arbitration, arguing a direct financial interest as any award against CPWD would ultimately be borne by IIT Mandi under their MoU. IIT Mandi contended that denial would violate natural justice and cited Supreme Court rulings on non-signatory binding. The contractor opposed, highlighting IIT Mandi's non-signatory status and lack of involvement in their contract.</p>\n\n<p>Both the arbitrator and the High Court rejected IIT Mandi's application. The High Court affirmed that arbitration is fundamentally consensual. IIT Mandi was not a signatory to the construction contract or its arbitration clause, and its MoU with CPWD was a distinct agreement. The Court ruled that financial consequences arising from a separate agreement do not automatically grant a non-signatory procedural rights in an unrelated arbitral proceeding. No express or implied consent by IIT Mandi to arbitrate with the contractor was found.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment signifies that the expansion of arbitration to non-signatories is an exception, not the rule. Courts will guard against transforming arbitration into multi-party civil litigation based solely on indirect financial implications. It cautions project owners and government bodies that downstream financial liability does not inherently confer arbitral procedural rights unless supported by clear contractual intent and conduct. Consent, whether express or implied, remains the cornerstone of arbitral jurisdiction; financial interest alone is legally insufficient.</p>",

    "title": "Unjust Enrichment Post-Resolution: Justice Sundaresan Holds Award-Creditor Cannot Keep Money that No Longer Exists in Law",
    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, in a significant ruling by Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan in Reliance Naval & Engineering Ltd. v. Afcons Infrastructure Ltd., addressed the intersection of arbitration and insolvency law. The judgment held that an award-creditor, having withdrawn a court deposit, must return the funds if the underlying claim is subsequently extinguished by an approved resolution plan under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC), citing unjust enrichment.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Reliance Naval, a corporate debtor, against whom an arbitral award of \u20b949.11 crores was passed in favor of Afcons Infrastructure. While challenging the award, Reliance deposited \u20b912.76 crores in court, which Afcons withdrew after furnishing a bank guarantee, thus making the withdrawal conditional. Subsequently, Reliance entered corporate insolvency resolution, and its approved plan reduced Afcons' claim to a symbolic Re. 1, extinguishing the original debt and providing a \"clean slate\" to the corporate debtor. Reliance then sought the return of the withdrawn amount.</p>\n\n<p>Reliance argued that the finality of the resolution plan extinguished Afcons' entitlement, making the money, as a corporate debtor's asset, revert to the resolution applicant. Afcons countered that the money ceased to be Reliance's asset post-withdrawal and that the bank guarantee protected its interest.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Sundaresan ruled that upon approval of the resolution plan, Afcons' claim, deemed a \"debt\" under IBC, stood statutorily expunged. Continued retention of the withdrawn sum would therefore constitute unjust enrichment. The Court clarified that the custodia legis principle merely regulates the fund's physical location, not its beneficial ownership. When the award's substratum vanished, the condition for withdrawal failed, necessitating restoration of the money. However, the Court rejected Reliance's claim for interest, deeming it a new cause of action beyond the scope of an interim application in an infructuous Section 34 petition.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, Afcons was directed to re-deposit the sum, failing which its bank guarantee would be invoked. This decision reaffirms that an approved resolution plan overrides pre-existing adjudicatory labels, and funds held in court are not immune from the IBC's statutory waterfall mechanism, ultimately reverting to the corporate debtor's revitalized assets.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The hypothetical capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by United States forces would represent a profound challenge to international law, despite being framed as a domestic law-enforcement action. This operation would directly violate core principles of state sovereignty, the prohibition on the use of force, and the absolute personal immunity afforded to sitting heads of state under customary international law.</p>\n\n<p>Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from using force against another's territorial integrity, a principle reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Exceptions like self-defense or Security Council authorization would not apply, as transnational criminal conduct doesn't constitute an \"armed attack.\" Furthermore, customary international law, as affirmed by the ICJ in Arrest Warrant, grants heads of state absolute immunity from foreign criminal jurisdiction. A unilateral armed seizure on foreign soil is akin to extraordinary rendition, not legitimate law enforcement, creating international responsibility irrespective of domestic prosecution.</p>\n\n<p>Such an operation, involving the forcible capture of a sitting head of state, could be deemed an act of aggression, profoundly interfering with a state\u2019s political independence. While not every unlawful use of force escalates into war, this could be classified as aggression, especially within a wider pattern of coercive conduct. Historical parallels, like the U.S. capture of Manuel Noriega, are not legal precedents; that invasion was widely condemned by the UN General Assembly for violating sovereignty. Isolated, condemned state actions do not establish new customary international law or justify future violations.</p>\n\n<p>Venezuela's legal avenues would include proceedings before the ICJ (facing jurisdictional hurdles without U.S. consent), engaging the UN Security Council or General Assembly for political condemnation, or implementing proportionate diplomatic and economic countermeasures. Ultimately, such an act fundamentally undermines the UN Charter and risks eroding the international legal order by normalizing unilateral assertions of power over established legal constraints, blurring the line between law enforcement and armed coercion.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Rajani Manohar Kuntha & Anr. v. Parshuram Chunilal Kanojiya & Ors., definitively clarified that the supervisory jurisdiction of High Courts under Article 227 is not a conduit for re-hearing appeals or undertaking a microscopic re-evaluation of evidence. The Court set aside a Bombay High Court judgment that had overturned concurrent eviction decrees.</p>\n\n<p>The case centered on a landlord seeking possession of non-residential premises for their daughter-in-law\u2019s commercial venture. Both the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court found the need to be bona fide and decreed eviction. However, the Bombay High Court, exercising its revisional powers, re-examined the evidence extensively, concluding that the landlord\u2019s case was insufficiently proven and that the tenant\u2019s offer of alternative accommodation was not adequately considered.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized that revisional powers are supervisory, reserved for instances where an inferior court's order is without jurisdiction or suffers from a glaring defect of law or procedure, not for delving deep into evidentiary terrain. It held that the High Court's actions amounted to an \"unauthorised re-trial,\" affirming that concurrent factual findings should not be disturbed unless perverse. The Court also reiterated that a tenant cannot impose alternative accommodation on a landlord and that a subsequent commercial electricity connection did not negate the landlord's genuine need for a property structurally suited for trade.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the SC allowed the appeal, restoring the judgments of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court, thereby reviving the eviction decree. Recognizing the tenants' five-decade occupation, the Court granted an extended period until June 30, 2026, for vacant possession, subject to clearing arrears and providing an undertaking. This decision reinforces the limited scope of revisional jurisdiction, ensuring predictability for landlords while balancing substantive rights with equitable considerations.</p>",

    "title": "Landmark Judgments in Arbitration (2025)",
    "description": "<p>The year 2025 witnessed several significant rulings in arbitration law across Indian courts. The Supreme Court notably affirmed that parties' conduct and correspondence can bind them to an unsigned arbitration agreement, rejecting attempts to escape terms based on a lack of signature. It also clarified that High Courts cannot review their Section 11 orders appointing arbitrators once the process has substantially progressed, upholding the principle of minimal judicial interference. Regarding the determination of governing law for arbitration agreements without explicit choice, the Court adopted the \"closest and most real connection\" test, generally linking it to the underlying contract's governing law. Furthermore, the Supreme Court ruled against appointing an arbitrator for non-parties to a contract under Section 11 and established the maintainability of writ petitions against Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act (MSMED Act) orders if the council acts without jurisdiction or violates natural justice.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court held that disputes arising from an ancillary agreement, even without an arbitration clause, could be referred to arbitration if the main agreement contains one, and confirmed that bilateral fraud allegations are arbitrable. Conversely, it ruled that disputes concerning the enforcement of mortgage rights are non-arbitrable due to involving rights in rem. The Court also permitted the partial setting aside of an arbitral award, specifically removing personal liability imposed on Designated Partners of an LLP while affirming the award against the LLP itself.</p>\n\n<p>The Delhi High Court, in its rulings, clarified that an exclusive jurisdiction clause in an agreement prevails over subsequent communications merely designating a different arbitration venue, asserting that the designated seat governs jurisdiction. It also declined to re-refer a claim to arbitration under Section 11 when a previous tribunal had already found no evidence to support it, preventing re-agitation of conclusively decided matters. Crucially, the Delhi High Court granted an anti-arbitration injunction in a foreign-seated arbitration, emphasizing its power to intervene in \"blatantly vexatious, unconscionable, oppressive\" proceedings or those violating public policy, such as an arbitrator's non-disclosure of a conflict of interest.</p>",

    "title": "No Forced Possession in Delayed Projects: REAT Jaipur Clarifies Scope of Refund Rights",
    "description": "<p>The Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, Jaipur (REAT), in Satish Sharma v. VVA Developers Pvt. Ltd., has significantly clarified allottees' refund rights under the RERA Act. This pivotal ruling underscores that project delay, non-execution of an Agreement for Sale, and arbitrary unit substitution decisively favor the allottee, even when promoters claim partial project completion.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from an allottee who booked a unit in 2013 and paid over 10% of the consideration, yet no Agreement for Sale was ever executed. Faced with prolonged delays and subsequent offers of different units after partial project completion, the allottee sought a full refund. The Regulatory Authority initially directed the promoter to either offer possession (with interest adjustment) or provide a refund minus 10% administrative charges if the allottee declined possession.</p>\n\n<p>REAT Jaipur modified this order, unequivocally stating that a promoter's failure to execute an Agreement for Sale (a breach of RERA Sections 13(1) and 13(2)) is a serious statutory violation, which prevents them from imposing contractual deductions like administrative charges. The Tribunal affirmed an allottee's unconditional right to a full refund with interest under Section 18(1) if possession is not delivered within the stipulated timeframe. Crucially, REAT ruled that refund rights are not diminished by partial project completion, belated possession offers, or unilateral substitution of units without the allottee's express consent. Allottees cannot be compelled to accept a unit never originally allotted to them.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the REAT directed the promoter to refund the entire deposited amount of \u20b96,47,212 with applicable interest, without any deductions, within 45 days. This decision reinforces RERA's core objective to protect homebuyers from promoter non-compliance, strengthening the jurisprudence around remedies for delayed projects and statutory breaches.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA) has issued a landmark ruling, directing a Bengaluru developer to facilitate katha (municipal property tax record) transfer to allottees within 30 days. This judgment, in Somashekar HG & Prakruti M v. Kavitha Ramreddy concerning project \"AQUATOWNN\", reinforces that post-sale title documentation is an enforceable obligation for promoters under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, not merely a formality.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from buyers' grievance of undue delay in katha mutation, despite an express undertaking in the indemnity bond and sale deed. These contractual documents explicitly stipulated the developer's responsibility to transfer/mutate e-katha within 60 days of sale deed registration. KRERA held that these covenants established a positive duty on the promoter to facilitate the mutation process. The Authority clarified that Section 17(1) of RERA views \"title completion\" as a trinity encompassing registered conveyance, occupancy certificate, and katha in the allottee's favour.</p>\n\n<p>While mandating specific performance for katha transfer, KRERA rejected the buyers' plea for EMI compensation. The Authority stated that RERA's remedial architecture, though pro-consumer, cannot create liabilities for ancillary financial outgoings absent explicit contractual stipulations. The order thus crystallises three key propositions: an indemnity bond under RERA constitutes an enforceable undertaking, katha facilitation is integral to title completion, and compensation for monetary fallout must be rooted in explicit contractual terms. This ruling aims to standardize katha hand-over mechanisms, reinforcing promoter accountability and guiding both developers and buyers on contractual safeguards and regulatory expectations.</p>",

This ruling decisively reaffirms an individual's sovereign control over the commercial and moral value of their face and voice in the era of synthetic media.</p>\n\n<p>Actor R. Madhavan sued multiple defendants, including platforms like Meta and Google, for unauthorized exploitation of his name, image, likeness, and voice. These personal attributes, asserted as distinctive identifiers and valuable commercial assets, were used in AI-generated deepfakes, morphed pornographic content, and unauthorized merchandise. Platforms were included to facilitate enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>The court established Madhavan's persona as both a proprietary and dignitary interest, rooted in constitutional Articles 19 and 21, performers' moral rights under the Copyright Act, and common law. It protects these rights from unauthorized commercial gain and recognizes that obscene deepfakes infringe upon dignity.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, the court distinguished AI-generated commercial exploitation from legitimate expressive uses. It ruled that AI-enabled personality cloning for deceptive advertising or pornographic content falls squarely outside fair dealing or free speech protections, considering AI an exacerbating factor in such infringements.</p>\n\n<p>The comprehensive interim relief restrains all identified and unknown infringers from using Madhavan's persona via any technology, including AI. A multi-layered enforcement strategy mandates video platforms to remove content, domain registrars to suspend infringing websites, merchandising platforms to delist products, and social media platforms to effect takedowns and disclose infringer details. This strategy assigns compliance costs to intermediaries and aids in identifying anonymous infringers.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment integrates personality rights as a robust economic interest, akin to a trademark, while firmly linking it to constitutional dignity.

This ruling clarifies that while the Passports Act, 1967, permits regulation, statutory restrictions must operate within defined legal and constitutional limits.</p>\n\n<p>The appellant, facing multiple criminal cases and a suspended sentence, secured permissions from trial courts for passport renewal, with conditions restricting foreign travel without prior judicial approval. However, the Regional Passport Office refused normal renewal, citing Section 6(2)(f) of the Act and demanding specific court permission for foreign travel for a defined period. This decision was upheld by the High Court, prompting an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court comprehensively interpreted the Passports Act, harmonizing Section 6(2)(f) (mandating refusal during criminal proceedings) with Section 22, which enables the Central Government to grant exemptions.

The case involved a borrower challenging a credit facility's ODR clause, which specified dispute resolution through the bank's Online Dispute Resolution Agency (ODRA) via a two-step process: mandatory conciliation followed by arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioner argued that there was no consensus on the arbitrator's identity and that the ODRA lacked statutory independence. However, the Court held that the petitioner's acceptance of the facility after receiving notice of the web-linked terms and conditions, coupled with a failure to object to ODRA intimations, constituted implied acceptance under Section 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

The scope of such certifications is strictly limited to food products for human consumption, with stringent penalties for contravention.</p>\n\n<p>A dedicated Committee on Certification of Religious Dietary Food Items is established to formulate and periodically update uniform national standards for all forms of religious dietary certifications, encompassing Halal, Kosher, and Jhatka. This committee ensures a balanced approach incorporating scientific expertise and inter-ministerial coordination, covering aspects like slaughter, processing, packaging, and labelling. The overarching intent is to enhance consumer confidence, ensure transparency, and uphold accountability within India's food safety regime by balancing respect for religious practices with public health and regulatory integrity.</p>",

    "title": "RERA\u2019s Iron Grip Strengthened: Courts Redefine Allottee Rights in Mortgages, Leases & Insolvency",
    "description": "<p>The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), enacted to safeguard homebuyers, has seen its authority significantly fortified by recent judicial interventions. These rulings have consistently prioritized allottee rights, challenging contractual loopholes and traditional financial claims.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, developers attempted to bypass RERA by structuring transactions as long-term \"leases\" (e.g., 999 years) rather than sales, claiming their customers were merely \"lessees\" outside RERA's purview. In Lavasa Corporation Ltd. vs. Jitendra Jagdish Tulsiani, courts applied the \"substance over form\" principle. They ruled that such agreements, involving substantial upfront \"premiums\" and minimal \"rent,\" were essentially sales, thereby confirming buyers as \"allottees\" under RERA and closing this potential loophole.</p>\n\n<p>A more profound challenge emerged from the conflict between homebuyers and banks. Banks, as \"secured creditors\" under the SARFAESI Act, would seize projects upon developer default, often leaving allottees who had paid for their units with no recourse. The Supreme Court, in Union Bank of India vs. Rajasthan RERA, delivered a landmark decision. It held that when a bank takes control of a RERA-registered project, it becomes a \"statutory assignee\" and therefore a \"promoter\" under RERA, assuming the original developer's liabilities to allottees. This decision effectively elevated RERA-secured homebuyer rights above SARFAESI-secured lenders' recovery rights, compelling banks to become de facto monitors of project compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Further strengthening allottee protection, the judiciary addressed conflicts with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). In Vishal Chelani v. Debashis Nanda, the Supreme Court rejected attempts to \"hyper-classify\" allottees, ensuring those seeking RERA refunds maintained their status as \"financial creditors\" under the IBC with equal priority. The Mansi Brar Fernandes v. Shubha Sharma ruling clarified that IBC protections are for \"genuine homebuyers\" seeking shelter, not speculative investors using assured return schemes. Crucially, this judgment also elevated the right to housing to a \"fundamental right\" derived from Article 21 of the Constitution, providing a robust constitutional foundation for allottee protection and advocating for \"project-by-project\" insolvency.</p>\n\n<p>These judicial interventions have profoundly redefined the homebuyer's status, transforming them from a mere contractual party to a beneficiary of a constitutionally protected \"fundamental right\" and a robust \"financial creditor\" in insolvency. This shift has imposed significant accountability on developers and financial institutions, fostering a more transparent and allottee-centric real estate ecosystem.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Madras High Court, in Sugesan Transport Pvt. Ltd. v. E.C. Bose & Company Pvt. Ltd., significantly clarified the limits of an arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction, particularly regarding the doctrines of lifting the corporate veil and alter ego, and the assessment of damages. The Court reaffirmed that arbitral awards must strictly adhere to the contractual framework and cannot extend obligations beyond the arbitration agreement.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) where Sugesan Transport advanced \u20b92.50 crores to E.C. Bose for a performance bank guarantee. E.C. Bose failed to repay the amount. During arbitration, E.C. Bose counter-claimed \u20b975 crores, alleging a joint venture for a KOPT contract and Sugesan's failure to supply equipment. The Arbitrator partially accepted both claims, directing repayment of \u20b92.50 crores to Sugesan but also awarding \u20b96.51 crores as damages to E.C. Bose, imputing equipment supply obligations to Sugesan based on documents signed by a third entity (Collate Consultants Pvt. Ltd.) and applying the \u2018alter ego\u2019 doctrine.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court held that an arbitral tribunal is a creature of contract and cannot extend liability to non-signatories or pierce the corporate veil; these powers are exclusive to courts. It found the Arbitrator's reliance on Collate Consultants' documents to impose obligations on Sugesan without jurisdiction. The Court further noted that the NCLAT and Supreme Court had already ruled the MoU was a standalone financial transaction, independent of any equipment supply obligations. Regarding damages, the Court stressed that under Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act, damages must be proven with actual loss and evidentiary basis, not speculative assumptions like the mere encashment of a bank guarantee.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the High Court partially set aside the arbitral award. It upheld the direction for E.C. Bose to repay \u20b92.50 crores to Sugesan Transport but entirely eliminated the counter-claim award of \u20b96.51 crores in favour of E.C. Bose, deeming it unsustainable. This judgment reinforces that arbitral tribunals must operate strictly within the arbitration agreement's contours, cannot apply doctrines like 'alter ego' to non-signatories, and damages must be strictly proven.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court, in `Rousanara Begum v. S.K. Salahuddin`, has decisively reaffirmed a divorced Muslim woman\u2019s non-negotiable economic rights. This landmark decision ensures her entitlement to property, money, and jewellery received at marriage, aligning with the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986. The ruling prioritizes securing dignity, equality, and financial protection, moving beyond technicalities to address women's vulnerabilities post-divorce.</p>\n\n<p>The Court clarified that a woman's ownership rights over such assets persist even after marriage ends. These gifts often serve as a woman's sole financial resource, offering critical economic security and personal dignity. The judgment reinforces Section 3 of the 1986 Act, interpreting it as social justice legislation grounded in constitutional values of equality, dignity, and autonomy (Article 21). It challenges patriarchal assumptions that absorb a woman's property into the marital household, protecting her from post-divorce vulnerability.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling emphasizes that legal interpretation must consider social realities and legislative intent, ensuring women's claims are not dismissed due to minor inconsistencies. It clarifies that the 1986 Act covers assets received \"before or at the time of marriage or after her marriage,\" aligning with Daniel Latifi principles for long-term financial stability. The Court instructs lower courts to adopt interpretations favoring women's empowerment and dignity. Ultimately, the decision reframes women as rights-bearing individuals with enforceable claims to property, reinforcing that a woman's property remains her own before, during, and after divorce. The SC overturned the High Court, directing the respondent to return assets with interest.</p>",

    "title": "Police Power versus Food Safety Officer Jurisdiction : Rajasthan High Court Clears the Air in Ravi v. State of Rajasthan",
    "description": "<p>The Rajasthan High Court, in Ravi v. State of Rajasthan, quashed an FIR and criminal proceedings involving food adulteration and misbranding under Sections 272, 273, and 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) read with the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSSA). The ruling re-established the primacy of the FSSA as a special law over general IPC provisions for identical conduct, emphasizing that once conduct is punishable under the more stringent FSSA, the general provisions of the IPC must yield.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioner argued that the FSSA, being a self-contained code with an \"over-riding effect\" under Section 89, supersedes IPC Sections 272 and 273 once an offence under FSSA Section 59 is made out. Furthermore, it was contended that only a qualified Food Safety Officer is authorized to investigate adulteration cases, not the police. The charge of cheating (IPC Section 420) was also contested due to the absence of allegations regarding inducement or wrongful loss to any purchaser. The State, conversely, argued that IPC offences retain independent identity and police are competent to investigate cognizable offences like IPC 420.</p>\n\n<p>Citing Supreme Court precedents (Ram Nath v. State of U.P. and Sushil Kumar Gupta v. State of West Bengal), the High Court affirmed that the FSSA, with its comprehensive and often more stringent provisions, overrides general IPC sections 272 and 273, thereby barring simultaneous prosecution. The court found no foundational facts for cheating under IPC 420 in the FIR, dismissing the charge. Crucially, it held that police investigation into adulteration contravenes the FSSA statutory scheme, which vests such powers exclusively in Food Safety Officers. Consequently, all proceedings from the FIR were quashed, though the competent food authority remains free to pursue remedies solely under the FSSA. This judgment reinforces that specific statutory codes with built-in safeguards take precedence over general criminal law for the same set of facts.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Punjab and Haryana High Court has reiterated that a formally expired driving license remains legally effective for the 30-day statutory grace period stipulated under Section 14(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. This judgment, delivered on November 21, 2025, dismissed an appeal by National Insurance Company Limited, denying the insurer any right to recover compensation it had paid to accident victims.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from an accident where the driver's license had expired on June 4, 2001, and the accident occurred on July 4, 2001, with renewal only on August 6, 2001. The insurer argued the driver was unlicensed, constituting a policy breach and entitling them to recovery. However, the vehicle owner contended that the accident, which happened at 10:45 a.m. on July 4, 2001, fell squarely within the 30-day grace period, which commenced on June 5, 2001, and expired at midnight on July 4, 2001.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Virinder Aggarwal, examining the provision's plain language, affirmed that the legislature explicitly defers the cessation of an expired license by thirty days. Citing precedents like State of Haryana & Anr. v. Karkor & Ors. and Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Smt. Santosh Kumari, the Court concluded that the driver was legally licensed at the time of the accident. Consequently, no breach of policy conditions occurred, and the insurer's plea for recovery was dismissed, affirming the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal's original award. This ruling emphasizes that the 30-day extension is a substantive continuation of license validity, necessitating insurers to factor this legislated continuum into their risk assessments.</p>",

    "description": "<p>India confronts a disturbing rise in industrial accidents, despite modern equipment and regulatory frameworks like the OSH Code 2020, which often foster administrative compliance over genuine safety leadership. The article underscores that true safety is a lived culture, not merely a presented metric, illustrated by an executive's silent gesture conveying, \"Safety is not something you present, it\u2019s something you live.\"</p>\n\n<p>Behaviour-Based Safety (BBS) is posited as the critical strategy to transform safety from a compliance exercise into a core leadership value and shared organizational habit. Inspired by DuPont's pioneering 1960s BBS program, which evolved from over a century of safety commitment, the author shares personal success implementing BBS in India. BBS moves beyond rules and checklists to foster a robust safety culture.</p>\n\n<p>While effective BBS implementation requires thorough understanding, as many companies prematurely abandon efforts, it yields significant benefits. Tangible improvements manifest in production, quality, delivery, sustainability, and morale within 10-15 months. Intangible gains include a vibrant culture, increased employee ownership, teamwork, and a harmonious workplace.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, safety is presented as a fundamental leadership mindset. Leaders' visible commitment\u2014demonstrated through curiosity on the shop floor, appreciation of safe behavior, and coaching\u2014builds an \"invisible shield\" protecting people and assets. This shift from prescribed rules to lived practice, where leaders' actions shape belief, cultivates a culture of excellence, trust, and pride, making safety synonymous with effective leadership.</p>",

LSPs are now barred from biased promotions for preferred Regulated Entities (REs).

Lenders must provide complete upfront information, including a prominent Key Fact Statement (KFS) detailing APR and all charges for informed consent.</p>\n\n<p>The Directions formalize RE-LSP relationships via mandatory contracts, requiring REs to perform enhanced due diligence and periodic reviews. Crucially, REs remain entirely responsible and liable for all LSP actions, affirming that financial duty of care cannot be delegated. All customer complaints related to Digital Lending Applications (DLAs) must be handled directly by the RE.</p>\n\n<p>Strict data norms enforce minimization and explicit consent. DLAs cannot access sensitive mobile data (contacts, call logs); any temporary access, e.g., camera for KYC, needs explicit, audited consent. Borrowers can withdraw consent and request data deletion.

This compulsory step ensures that additional covenants (e.g., penal interest, construction milestones, amenities promises) or bespoke riders, whether pre- or post-registration, are publicly attested. This closes the loophole of promoters later inserting supplementary sheets. Non-compliance will lead to penalties, including refusal or revocation of project registration.</p>\n\n<p>Parallel to this, the circular mandates that only the RERA Collection Account number must be displayed across all project documentation\u2014including sale deeds, allotment letters, brochures, and website banners. Any reference to alternative bank accounts (escrow, partnership, or group company accounts) is strictly prohibited. This aims to funnel all payments into the Authority\u2019s dashboard-integrated account, permitting real-time reconciliation and enhancing transparency.

    "description": "<p>The Allahabad High Court's judgment in Suryadev Pathak vs. Union of India elucidates the jurisdictional limitations of constitutional courts when statutory remedies are available. The case stemmed from Suryadev Pathak, a landowner, seeking enhanced compensation for land acquired under the National Highways Act, 1956, for the Bharat Mala Scheme. Dissatisfied with the initial compensation, Pathak invoked the arbitration mechanism specified in Section 3G(5) of the Act.</p>\n\n<p>When the appointed arbitrator delayed rendering a decision for over two years, Pathak filed a writ petition under Article 226, alleging violations of his constitutional rights (Articles 14, 21, 300-A) and seeking expeditious resolution. The respondents countered, arguing that the High Court lacked jurisdiction as the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (A&C Act), provides a comprehensive framework, including provisions for timeline extensions exclusively by designated civil courts, not constitutional courts.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court's analysis centered on the maintainability of writ jurisdiction when alternative statutory remedies exist, and the validity of mandating arbitration after statutory timelines expire. The court reasoned that upon the expiration of timelines prescribed by the A&C Act, specifically Section 29A, an arbitrator's mandate ceases. Consequently, any subsequent proceedings for timeline extensions must be adjudicated by competent civil courts, not through extraordinary writ jurisdiction, to prevent undermining legislative schemes and encouraging forum shopping.</p>\n\n<p>The court dismissed the writ petition, establishing three fundamental principles: arbitration under Section 3G(5) of the NH Act is governed by the A&C Act; constitutional courts cannot exercise writ jurisdiction where specific and efficacious statutory remedies exist; and only competent civil courts possess the authority to extend arbitration timelines after an arbitrator's mandate expires. This judgment reinforces the integrity of specialized legislative frameworks, emphasizing the primacy of statutory arbitration over extraordinary constitutional intervention in land acquisition disputes.</p>",
