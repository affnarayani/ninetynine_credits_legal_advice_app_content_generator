    "description": "<p>The Draft Energy Conservation (Compliance Enforcement) Rules, 2025, represent a significant shift in the enforcement of India's Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. Previously reliant on data submissions and administrative follow-up, CAFE compliance is now being elevated to a legally binding obligation with defined penalties for non-compliance. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) will administer these rules under the Energy Conservation Act, 2001.</p>\n\n<p>These rules directly affect all Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) selling passenger vehicles in India, both domestic and foreign. Automakers are now subject to a clear, statutory process for identifying and penalizing CAFE non-compliance. This includes mandatory reporting and verification procedures. If found in violation, automakers face financial penalties and have the right to appeal, first to the Adjudicating Officer and then to the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity.</p>\n\n<p>The implementation of these rules will require automakers to prioritize both achieving fuel efficiency targets through product strategy and maintaining rigorous reporting systems. The shift from policy oversight to a statutory, penalty-backed regime transforms CAFE compliance from a peripheral corporate responsibility to a central element of risk management and governance within the automotive industry.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India recently adjudicated the case of *Anurag Vijaykumar Goel v. State of Maharashtra & Anr.*, dissolving a marriage on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown and addressing related criminal proceedings. The court aimed to deliver complete justice after years of marital discord where reconciliation proved impossible.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a second marriage between the appellant and respondent, which lasted only one year and nine months. Disputes arose, leading to allegations of harassment and domestic violence from both sides. The wife initiated criminal prosecution under the Domestic Violence Act, while the husband filed for divorce and alleged contempt after the wife withdrew from a mutual consent agreement. The Supreme Court appeal followed the High Court's refusal to quash the criminal proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>Exercising its power under Article 142, the Supreme Court dissolved the marriage, deeming it unworkable and beyond repair. The court also quashed criminal proceedings under Section 498-A of the IPC, citing the allegations as vague and disproportionate to marital disputes. As a condition of the divorce, the husband was ordered to settle outstanding apartment maintenance charges and execute a gift deed for the Mumbai apartment and parking spaces in favor of the wife, providing her with significant compensation and allowing both parties to move forward. This ruling offers valuable guidance for similar matrimonial cases in the future.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court in *Sincere Securities Pvt. Ltd. v. Chandrakant Khemka* reaffirmed the primacy of the Committee of Creditors' (CoC) commercial wisdom during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). The Court overturned the NCLAT's order and reinstated the NCLT's directive for the Resolution Professional (RP) to return possession of a mortgaged property to the appellants, who were financial creditors.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a loan default by Nandini Impex Private Limited, which had mortgaged property to secure financial assistance from Sincere Securities Pvt. Ltd. and others. Following initiation of CIRP by UCO Bank, the sole CoC member, it was determined that retaining the property was unviable. The NCLT approved the handover, but the NCLAT reversed this decision, citing Section 14(1)(d) of the IBC, which imposes a moratorium on recovery of property occupied by the debtor during CIRP.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized that the CoC's commercial wisdom is paramount and non-justiciable, referencing its prior decision in *K. Sashidhar v. Indian Overseas Bank*. It clarified that Section 14(1)(d) was not applicable because the CoC and RP had proactively chosen to surrender the property, representing a consensual decision within the CIRP framework, not a creditor-initiated recovery. The Court dismissed objections from the suspended director as obstructive and without merit and directed the RP to promptly hand over the property. This decision reinforces creditor control and aims to prevent undue delays in the CIRP process.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Hindu Succession Act (HSA) of 1956, despite a 2005 amendment aimed at gender parity, contains Section 2(2) which excludes Scheduled Tribe women from statutory inheritance rights unless specifically notified by the Central Government. This exclusion was challenged in *Manni Devi v. Rama Devi & Ors.* before the Rajasthan High Court, highlighting how legislative inaction perpetuates structural inequality.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a Meena woman, Manni Devi, who contested a gift deed executed by her father that transferred ancestral land to another party, effectively denying her inheritance. Her claim was dismissed by the Board of Revenue based on Section 2(2) of the HSA. The Rajasthan High Court reviewed the matter to decide if the petitioner can contest the alienation of ancestral property given the exception stated in Section 2(2).</p>\n\n<p>Justice Anoop Kumar Dhand noted the exclusionary section and set aside the Board of Revenue's order, restoring Manni Devi's claim to be heard on its merits. The Court emphasized the need for urgent legislative reform or a central notification to extend the HSA's benefits to Scheduled Tribe women. Ultimately, the court restored Manni Devi's claim, and called for legislative action.</p>\n\n<p>The court recognized that inheritance rights are fundamental to economic empowerment and social equality. Amending Section 2(2) or issuing a central notification is necessary to ensure uniform property rights for all women in India, regardless of community status, transforming court pronouncements into lasting, uniform rights for all women in India. The *Manni Devi* verdict highlights the legal gap that deprives tribal women of their inheritance, emphasizing that equality and dignity should be unconditional and universally applied.</p>",

The case highlights the court's approach to balancing genuine need against the proven capacity to pay, particularly when both spouses are past retirement age and have been separated for an extended period.</p>\n\n<p>Yashwani and Virender married in 1978 but separated in 1987. A joint divorce petition filed in 2003 lapsed when Yashwani withdrew her consent. In 2021, Yashwani filed a petition seeking to declare any second marriage by Virender as void and simultaneously sought interim maintenance of \u20b960,000 per month.</p>\n\n<p>The Family Court rejected the maintenance plea, citing that both parties were of advanced age, living separately by choice, and that Yashwani was supported by her employed sons. It also invoked Section 125(4) Cr.P.C., which disallows maintenance for spouses living separately without sufficient cause.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed the Family Court's decision, emphasizing that Section 24 HMA serves to prevent destitution rather than equalize lifestyles. The court considered Yashwani's resources, including pension, tuition income, investments, and support from her sons, and found them adequate. Conversely, it noted Virender's unemployment, debt, and lack of retiral benefits. The court concluded that the maintenance plea appeared driven by the alleged second marriage and property dealings rather than genuine financial distress. The ruling clarifies that age does not guarantee entitlement and that courts will carefully assess need and capacity to pay in long-standing marital disputes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued Circular No. RBI/2025-26/71 on August 5, 2025, relaxing regulations for Indian banks regarding trade settlement in Indian Rupees (INR). This update allows Category-I Authorised Dealer (AD) banks to open Special Rupee Vostro Accounts (SRVAs) for foreign banks with whom they already have correspondent banking relationships, without needing prior approval from the RBI. SRVAs facilitate cross-border INR payments for trade with India.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, AD Category-I banks required case-by-case RBI approval to establish an SRVA, a process initiated in July 2022 to enable international trade transactions in INR. The new circular streamlines this process, removing a layer of administrative oversight while requiring continued adherence to Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) norms under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999 and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act of 2002.</p>\n\n<p>This regulatory change is intended to accelerate rupee-based trade settlements, reduce procedural delays, and promote the broader adoption of the INR in global trade. By empowering AD Category-I banks to independently open SRVAs while maintaining regulatory compliance, the RBI aims to reduce friction for businesses, strengthen India\u2019s trade settlement infrastructure, and position the rupee as a credible and widely-used international currency.</p>",

The case, handled under the summary judgment framework of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, arose from instances where defendants falsely represented themselves as authorized dealers of Tata Power, misleading consumers and causing financial harm.</p>\n\n<p>Despite prior interim injunctions, the defendants continued their infringing activities, prompting Tata Power to seek further legal recourse. The court noted the defendants' failure to appear or file written statements, leading to the acceptance of the plaintiff's claims as admitted under the Delhi High Court Rules. Citing the *Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd. v. Kunwer Sachdev* case, the court emphasized that summary judgment is appropriate when a defendant has no real prospect of a successful defense.</p>\n\n<p>The court also ordered the suspension of infringing domain names and the freezing of related bank accounts. Furthermore, the court issued a dynamic injunction, enabling Tata Power to take action against future infringers without needing to initiate new legal proceedings for each instance of trademark misuse. The judgment underscores the Indian courts' commitment to protecting intellectual property rights and provides a swift and effective mechanism for brand protection in the digital age.</p>",

The current framework limits strategic investors to committing between 5% and 25% of the total offer size, with eligible entities subject to a 180-day lock-in period post-listing. Key institutional investors like pension funds, AIFs, and VCFs are currently excluded.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed changes seek to expand the pool of eligible strategic investors by including Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs), specific categories of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs), Multilateral Financial Institutions, and certain Development Financial Institutions, subject to specified conditions. This aims to facilitate early participation by long-term investors, potentially boosting investor confidence and subscription performance.</p>\n\n<p>SEBI's rationale includes enhancing the depth and stability of REIT and InvIT markets, attracting diverse investor participation, and aligning with global practices. The regulator has invited public comments until August 22, 2025, before finalizing and notifying the amended regulations. The anticipated outcomes encompass increased institutional participation, improved anchor investor confidence, and enhanced subscription quality, which are crucial for sustaining the growth of India's infrastructure and real estate sectors under initiatives like the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and Gati Shakti. The expansion of strategic investor eligibility aligns with the growing interest of institutional capital in these sectors.</p>",

This follows an initial warning issued in December 2024, with the persistence of fraudulent activities necessitating a stronger regulatory response.</p>\n\n<p>The new circular mandates a four-step action plan for RAs upon detecting impersonation.

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court's judgment in *Shri Shri Swami Samarth Construction & Finance Solution v. Board of Directors, NKGSB Co-operative Bank Ltd.* clarifies the interplay between special insolvency measures for MSMEs and the SARFAESI Act. The case involved a borrower registered under the MSMED Act, 2006, who defaulted on a loan from NKGSB Co-operative Bank, leading to the account being classified as a non-performing asset (NPA). The borrower challenged the bank's actions under SARFAESI, citing non-compliance with the \"Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises\" issued in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The borrower argued that the 2015 Framework mandates lenders to identify incipient stress in MSME accounts before classifying them as NPAs, a duty allegedly not fulfilled by the bank. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, emphasizing that the Framework envisages a collaborative mechanism between lender and borrower. While banks are expected to identify stress, the MSME also has a responsibility to proactively engage the framework if it anticipates financial distress.</p>\n\n<p>The Court held that a bank, without conscious knowledge of the borrower's MSME status, can proceed with NPA classification and demand notices under Section 13(2) of SARFAESI. Upon receiving such a notice, the borrower can then assert its MSME status, triggering the lender's obligation to pause, examine the claim, and explore revival options if the Framework's conditions are met. The court distinguished the case from *Pro Knits v. Canara Bank*, emphasizing the MSME's duty to present authenticated material early in the process. Delaying the assertion of MSME status until late in the enforcement process, or after unsuccessful challenges in other forums, would not be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Court dismissed the writ petition, underscoring that Article 32 jurisdiction is not a substitute for statutory appellate remedies. The judgment reinforces that MSME borrowers must actively engage with the Framework to benefit from its protections, while lenders must be prepared to facilitate revival efforts once an MSME borrower properly invokes the Framework.</p>",

Ltd.* clarifies key aspects of patent infringement analysis and the standards for equitable relief in patent litigation, reinforcing the balance between protecting innovation and ensuring fair market competition. The case underscores the necessity of a proper \"product-to-patent\" comparison, where a defendant's product is assessed against the patent's claims rather than the patentee's product.</p>\n\n<p>The court reiterated the principles governing equitable remedies like interim injunctions, including the defendant's ability to raise a credible challenge to the patent's validity based on Section 107 of the Patents Act 1970. A credible challenge requires scientific material and expert evidence to demonstrate potential revocation under Section 64 due to lack of novelty or inventive step. The High Court criticized the lower court for incorrectly shifting the burden of proving novelty to the plaintiff and failing to properly evaluate prior art.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling emphasizes that once a plaintiff establishes prima facie infringement, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove the patent's vulnerability. The court also found no substantial evidence to support allegations of prior art suppression against Mold-Tek. This decision reaffirms essential doctrines in patent litigation, including rigorous infringement analysis based on claim interpretation, upholding the burden of proof standards, and preserving the equitable nature of injunctive relief. The judgment provides a crucial procedural and doctrinal foundation for patent litigation in India, particularly in sectors like pharmaceuticals, biotech, and manufacturing.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India's decision in *S. Mohammed Hakkim v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors.* significantly impacts motor accident compensation law by enhancing the appellant's compensation to \u20b991.39 lakh. The court revisited the concept of contributory negligence and adopted a forward-looking approach to assess future earning potential, especially for students. This judgment clarifies the apportionment of liability among multiple parties and emphasizes that compensation should reflect the actual economic and social consequences of severe injuries.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from an accident where the appellant, an engineering student, suffered a severe injury resulting in the amputation of his leg after colliding with a car that braked suddenly, followed by being run over by a bus. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) initially awarded \u20b991.62 lakh, deducting 20% for contributory negligence. However, the Madras High Court increased the negligence to 30%, apportioned liability among the car driver, bus driver, and appellant, and reduced the overall award to \u20b958.53 lakh.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court scrutinized these findings, holding that while the appellant contributed to the accident by not maintaining sufficient distance and lacking a valid license, the car driver's abrupt braking on a high-speed highway was the primary cause. Consequently, the court apportioned negligence and recalculated the compensation based on the appellant's potential future income as an engineering graduate. Referring to precedents like *Navjot Singh v. Harpreet Singh*, *Sarla Verma v. DTC*, and *National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi*, the court fixed a notional income, factored in future prospects, applied an appropriate multiplier, and restored reduced attendant charges and increased compensation for loss of marital prospects, leading to a final compensation of \u20b991.39 lakh after factoring in the 20% contributory negligence.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's judgment reaffirms the importance of contextual and proportional evaluation of contributory negligence, particularly when another driver's recklessness is a major contributing factor. It underscores that compensation should comprehensively address both financial and social implications of life-altering injuries. The ruling reinforces the higher duty of care expected from drivers on highways, particularly regarding signaling intentions, and sets a precedent for future cases involving young victims and multi-vehicle accidents, blending legal rigor with a compassionate understanding of the law's purpose.</p>",

The ruling aims to address systemic failures highlighted by a tragic case of a NEET aspirant's death.</p>\n\n<p>Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau indicate a concerning rise in student suicides, with 13,044 cases reported in 2022 alone. Recognizing suicide as a preventable tragedy, the Court addressed a specific case involving the suspicious death of a student, Ms. X, enrolled in a coaching center.

The Court held that Section 18 requires a written acknowledgment of liability, signed before the expiration of the prescribed period, to trigger a fresh limitation period.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized that Section 18 must be interpreted strictly, as limitation laws are substantive and prevent stale claims. An acknowledgment cannot extend limitation for a time-barred or unacknowledged claim, or for new or future claims. This ruling prevents the misuse of Section 18 by claimants attempting to revive entire claims through partial acknowledgments and reinforces the importance of ensuring that any acknowledgment relied upon is express, written, and acknowledges the full extent of the liability claimed.</p>",

This decision reinforces the importance of reasonable accommodation and the enforceability of industrial settlements under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.</p>\n\n<p>The appellant, Ch. Joseph, was retired after being found color blind during a routine medical check-up, despite a 1979 Memorandum of Settlement (MOS) mandating alternate employment for drivers with this condition. The corporation relied on internal circulars to justify the retirement. The Supreme Court ruled that the 1979 MOS was a binding, quasi-statutory instrument that was not overridden by a later, more general agreement. The Court also found that the internal circulars could not supersede the binding settlement. Moreover, the employer failed to assess Joseph's suitability for alternative roles.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court highlighted the constitutional and statutory duty to provide reasonable accommodation to employees acquiring disabilities during their service. It clarified that protection under Section 47 of the PwD Act must be interpreted broadly to promote inclusion and dignity. The Court directed the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation to reinstate Joseph in a suitable non-driving role with back pay and continuous service. This judgment reaffirms the rights of employees acquiring disabilities during service, emphasizing that settlements, statutory schemes, and constitutional principles cannot be undermined by administrative convenience.</p>",

    "title": "Understanding Partial Acknowledgment and Section 18 of the Limitation Act",
    "description": "<p>The Limitation Act of 1963 establishes timeframes for initiating legal action, preventing the revival of stale claims and ensuring legal finality. Section 18 of the Act allows for the extension of the limitation period under specific conditions, requiring a written and signed acknowledgment of liability. However, the Supreme Court has clarified the application of Section 18, particularly concerning partial acknowledgments of debt.</p>\n\n<p>The Limitation Act is based on principles demanding timely pursuit of legal remedies within statutory periods. Section 18 provides a mechanism to reset the limitation period when specific conditions are met: an acknowledgment of liability made in writing, signed by the liable party, and made before the expiration of the prescribed limitation period. Fulfilling these conditions triggers a fresh limitation period computed from the acknowledgment's signing date.</p>\n\n<p>The key principle is that an acknowledgment of a partial debt only extends the limitation period for that acknowledged portion, not the entire claim. This interpretation aligns with the statutory construction and objectives of limitation jurisprudence.</p>",

These amendments refine labeling norms, documentation standards, licensing processes, and the responsibilities of regulatory authorities, emphasizing accountability, traceability, and alignment with international best practices.</p>\n\n<p>Key changes include clarifying the definitions of \"use before\" and \"expiry date\" to ensure consistent interpretation, and replacing \"Controlling Officer\" with \"Controlling Authority\" to reinforce decision-making powers of licensing bodies. Licensees are now required to maintain batch-wise records of raw materials and final products for traceability, with exceptions for soap manufacturers. The Central Drugs Laboratory is officially designated as the Central Cosmetics Laboratory, empowered with appellate functions to reinforce sample analysis credibility.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the State Licensing Authority can suspend or cancel licenses for non-compliance, subject to due process, re-defining licensing as a conditional right. Export regulations are eased by allowing labeling to comply with importing country laws, while ensuring traceability via code numbers. The amendments also strengthen actions against spurious cosmetics and encourage secure sample transportation methods. Finally, terminology related to testing institutions is updated to clarify their approval process distinct from manufacturing licenses.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the Cosmetics (Amendment) Rules, 2025, aim to create a more resilient and internationally aligned regulatory environment in India, demanding demonstrable commitment to consumer safety and product integrity.</p>",

These provisions dictate the conditions under which a PoA executed before a foreign notary public can be presumed validly executed and authenticated in Indian courts.</p>\n\n<p>Section 84 of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, establishes a legal presumption in favor of a PoA authenticated by a Notary Public, Court, Judge, Magistrate, Indian Consul or Vice-Consul, or representative of the Central Government, but the application of \"Notary Public\" to foreign notaries is not explicitly defined, necessitating consideration of the Notaries Act, 1952. Section 14 of the Notaries Act empowers the Central Government to establish reciprocal arrangements with other countries, recognizing notarial acts performed by foreign notaries only if the country is designated as a \"reciprocating country\" via official notification.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court of Kerala's judgment in *Margret @ Thankam v. Joseph Mathew Chettupuzha* clarified that the presumption of authenticity under Section 84 of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, cannot be applied to a foreign-notarized PoA unless the country is a \"reciprocating country\" under Section 14 of the Notaries Act. The court emphasized that these provisions must be read together, preventing the unilateral recognition of foreign notarial acts. This interpretation ensures a structured process for recognizing foreign-executed documents.</p>\n\n<p>For a PoA executed before a foreign notary to be considered valid in India, the country of execution must be a \"reciprocating country.\" Otherwise, the PoA should be authenticated by an Indian Consul, Vice-Consul, or a representative of the Central Government, as provided for in Section 84 of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, to ensure its legal validity and enforceability in India. This offers practical guidance and creates a more fraud-resistant system.</p>",

This stance emphasizes the importance of due process and individual rights within criminal procedure, even amidst technological advancements.</p>\n\n<p>Section 35 BNSS, similar to the former Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code, requires individuals against whom there's a reasonable suspicion of a cognizable offense to receive a \"notice to appear.\" This notice offers an opportunity to cooperate with the investigation before potential arrest. The Court insists on personal service to ensure unambiguous communication, given that non-compliance can lead to arrest.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling emerged from an application within the Satinder Kumar Antil v. Central Bureau of Investigation proceedings. The State of Haryana argued that since the new BNSS allows electronic service for certain court-issued summons, the same should apply to police summons under Section 35 BNSS. The Court rejected this, distinguishing between the \"judicial act\" of a court summons and the \"executive act\" of a police notice, the latter directly impacting personal liberty. The Court observed that provisions like Sections 93 and 193 of the BNSS, which allow electronic communication for producing documents or forwarding reports, do not have the same immediate bearing on personal liberty as a Section 35 notice.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision safeguards personal liberty by requiring verifiable notice in criminal proceedings, preventing potential arbitrary actions by investigating agencies, and reinforcing the principles of natural justice.</p>",

Its purpose was to enable the IBBI to monitor assignments, detect conflicts of interest, prevent forum shopping, and gain a comprehensive view of the insolvency ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>However, the static nature of Form IP-1 proved insufficient for the fast-paced environment of insolvency proceedings. The Assignment Module, mandated in February 2025, provided a real-time reporting system for IP appointments, resignations, and replacements. This Module functions as a dynamic ledger, timestamping events, triggering compliance alerts, and interfacing with other modules.  The Assignment Module applies to all types of insolvency proceedings ensuring comprehensive oversight.</p>\n\n<p>The introduction of forms CP-1 through CP-5 in May 2025 further streamlined the process by replacing both the previous CIRP Forms 1-8 and Form IP-1.

Nayana Krishna* clarifies the boundaries of civil liability in defamation suits involving multinational tech companies and their Indian subsidiaries. The case addresses the crucial intersection of defamation law, intermediary liability, and corporate identity in the digital age.</p>\n\n<p>The suit was originally filed against 21 defendants, including Google India, alleging the dissemination of defamatory content. Google India sought to be removed from the suit, arguing the absence of specific allegations or evidence linking it to the defamatory acts. The trial court rejected this application, leading to Google India's appeal to the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court framed the key issues as whether Google India was a necessary party, whether the plaint contained sufficient detail to establish defamation, and whether Google India's corporate structure justified its inclusion given the content was hosted on platforms operated by distinct foreign entities. The court emphasized the need for specific pleadings detailing the defamatory material, context, and responsible entity. It reiterated that generalized claims are insufficient, especially concerning digital platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The court distinguished Google India from its parent company, Google LLC, noting Google India's role as a non-exclusive reseller of online advertising and provider of technical support. Absent evidence of direct involvement, the court rejected the assumption that shared branding equated to liability. The High Court ultimately allowed Google India's petition, setting aside the trial court's order and removing Google India from the suit, reasoning that its inclusion represented an abuse of process.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment reinforces the need for detailed pleadings in defamation cases and respects the distinct legal identities of domestic subsidiaries. It also aligns with global trends aimed at protecting intermediary platforms from unwarranted litigation, unless their role in unlawful acts is clearly substantiated under statutory frameworks.

    "description": "<p>The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Kochi Bench, ruled on July 9, 2025, that the liquidator of Raihan Healthcare Private Limited is not obligated to honor penalties assessed by the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) after the company entered liquidation. The case originated from a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) initiated against the hospital chain in March 2019, followed by a liquidation order in February 2020, appointing a liquidator.</p>\n\n<p>The EPFO initially filed a claim of \u20b91.73 crore for unpaid PF dues, which the liquidator admitted and subsequently paid \u20b91.90 crore, treating employer and employee contributions as exempt from the liquidation estate. A revised claim of \u20b94.72 crore was later submitted by the EPFO in 2023, including additional dues, damages, and interest based on post-liquidation assessments. The liquidator rejected this additional demand, prompting the EPFO to file an application under Section 60(5) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, seeking priority payment of the balance \u20b92.82 crore.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLT sided with the liquidator, holding that assessments conducted after the liquidation order are void due to the moratorium under Sections 14 and 33(5) of the Code. While basic contributions remain protected, penal damages and interest arising from post-liquidation orders are not entitled to priority or exemption. The Tribunal dismissed the EPFO's application, limiting their claim to the \u20b91.90 crore already disbursed, effectively ending the dispute.</p>",

    "title": "BBMP Advertisement Bye-Laws, 2024: A New Legal Framework for Bengaluru\u2019s Outdoor Advertising",
    "description": "<p>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) introduced the Advertisement Bye-Laws, 2024, effective July 17, 2025, under the Greater Bengaluru Governance Act, 2024. This comprehensive framework replaces the 2006 and 2018 bye-laws, aiming to standardize advertising practices, protect urban aesthetics, prevent unauthorized displays, and ensure transparent commercial exploitation of advertising spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Key regulatory features include structured licensing and registration for advertisers, with licenses valid for five years and subject to renewal. The allocation of advertising rights on notified roads and areas is conducted through public auction or tender via e-procurement, governed by the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act, 1999. Spatial restrictions and density norms are enforced, with minimum spacing requirements between hoardings and restrictions based on road width.</p>\n\n<p>The bye-laws also address ownership, taxation, and ground rent, stipulating that payment of advertisement fees to BBMP does not confer land rights and that advertisers must secure agreements with landowners. Environmental and safety compliance is mandated, requiring biodegradable materials and prohibiting plastic or PVC flexes, diesel generators, and disruptive illumination. Legacy advertisements are temporarily protected, while infrastructure advertisements are subject to separate tendering. Certain self-advertisements and advertisements by public utilities are exempt from fees under defined conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Enforcement mechanisms are codified, including penalties for non-compliance and removal of unauthorized displays. An Advertisement Regulatory Committee (ARC) oversees implementation, resolves disputes, and hears appeals. The bye-laws advance consumer protection by preventing misleading claims and ensuring public safety through structural stability requirements. Overall, the BBMP Advertisement Bye-Laws, 2024, represent a significant step toward structured commercialization of outdoor advertising, embedding transparency, environmental accountability, and public safety principles.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court Cancels Bail in Shelter Home Abuse Case: Reaffirming Victim Rights and Institutional Accountability",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in *Victim \u2018X\u2019 v. State of Bihar & Anr.*, overturned the bail granted to a shelter home superintendent accused of facilitating immoral trafficking and sexual exploitation of women inmates. The ruling, delivered on July 21, 2025, underscores the importance of considering the gravity of the offense, societal impact, and victim participation in bail decisions, particularly under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from systemic abuse at a government-run women's shelter home, where the superintendent allegedly administered intoxicating injections to inmates, enabling their sexual exploitation. The High Court granted bail to the accused, citing a lack of specific allegations, without impleading or hearing the victim, violating Section 15A(3) of the SC/ST Act. The Supreme Court emphasized that the High Court's order lacked adequate reasoning and breached procedural safeguards.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court held that the High Court erred in granting bail and highlighted the gravity of the allegations, the violation of the victim's right to be heard, the lack of reasoning in the bail order, and the threat to a fair trial posed by the accused's release. The Supreme Court cancelled the bail, ordering the accused to surrender and instructing the Trial Court and District Administration to protect victims and witnesses. This decision fortifies victim rights under the SC/ST Act, demands reasoned bail orders in cases of institutional abuse, and reinforces institutional accountability, advancing gender justice and social equity.</p>",

    "title": "Caste Abuse, Water Inequality, and the Law: A Tenkasi Woman\u2019s Fight for Dignity",
    "description": "<p>The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court addressed a case, *Thirumalaisamy v. State of Tamil Nadu*, involving a man convicted under the SC/ST Act for caste-based abuse of a Dalit woman. The case highlighted the persistent issue of caste discrimination in rural India, specifically concerning access to drinking water.</p>\n\n<p>Thirumalaisamy was convicted for using caste-based slurs against the victim during an altercation on her land and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment. Justice R.N. Manjula granted a suspension of the sentence but expanded the scope of the case in response to the victim's testimony regarding water inequality, where Dalit households were forced to wait until dominant castes finished using a public tap. The Court emphasized that access to clean water is a fundamental right integral to the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution, decrying the rule of the mighty over the rule of law.</p>\n\n<p>The Court issued specific directives to the District Collector of Tenkasi to ensure the prevention of caste-based discrimination in Thalaivankonttai village. These directives included the installation of adequate public water taps with equitable access for all communities, prohibiting any single community from claiming exclusive control over public water sources. A compliance report is due by July 31, 2025. The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in addressing social injustice beyond legal technicalities, recognizing that caste discrimination extends beyond overt acts of violence to include subtle denials of basic necessities.</p>",
