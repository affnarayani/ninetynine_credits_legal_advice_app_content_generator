    "title": "Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace: Bombay HC Clears ICC, Denies Tarapur Doctor a Second Bite After Year-Long Silence Makes Waiver Win the POSH Fight",
    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court has affirmed that silence during a sexual harassment inquiry can amount to a waiver of procedural objections, denying a doctor's petition to quash an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) report. In the case of Dr Shyam Bihari v. Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd., the court emphasized that participating in proceedings without protest precludes subsequent challenges to the ICC's composition or procedure, and reiterated the correct interpretation of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act).</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Shyam Bihari, a Medical Officer at NPCIL's Tarapur site, faced an inquiry after a complaint of inappropriate behavior in July 2024. An ICC was swiftly constituted, headed by a woman medical officer of the same grade as Dr. Bihari, along with other members including an external expert. After recording statements and conducting an inquiry, the ICC, applying the \"preponderance of probabilities\" standard, concluded in December 2024 that the allegations were proven, despite an earlier preliminary note observing \"insufficient evidence.\"</p>\n\n<p>Instead of submitting a representation to the disciplinary authority, Dr. Bihari petitioned the High Court in August 2025, seeking to quash the proceedings. His primary arguments centered on the Presiding Officer not being senior in rank to him, the \"external\" member having a consultancy contract with NPCIL, and an apprehension of bias due to another member living in the same building as the complainant's father. He also referenced a Department of Personnel & Training memorandum regarding the seniority of inquiry officers in general disciplinary cases.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court dismissed Dr. Bihari's petition, highlighting his year-long participation in the inquiry without raising any objections. Justice Bhobe, writing for the Bench, applied the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation, noting that Section 4(2)(a) of the POSH Act requires the Presiding Officer to be a \"senior-level woman,\" not necessarily senior in rank to the accused. The court found no material evidence of the ENT surgeon being an employee or that the neighbor-member influenced the panel. Furthermore, it clarified that the October note was an interim assessment, and the December report applied the correct standard of proof. The court also reminded the petitioner that the POSH Act provides a self-contained appeal mechanism to a court or tribunal once the disciplinary authority issues final orders, making his writ petition premature.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment serves as a critical reminder that procedural objections in an inquiry must be raised at the earliest opportunity. It reinforces that meticulously conducted ICC inquiries, adhering to the statutory checklist and principles of natural justice, will withstand judicial scrutiny, even if the Presiding Officer is not hierarchically senior to the accused, provided they meet the \"senior-level woman\" requirement. The ruling clears the path for NPCIL's disciplinary authority to proceed with determining the appropriate penalty.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court: Non-Resident Companies Liable to Tax in India Even Without Permanent Office",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India recently delivered a significant judgment in the case of Pride Foramer S.A. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, clarifying that non-resident companies can be deemed to be carrying on business in India even during periods of operational inactivity, thus remaining eligible for tax deductions and liable for tax on income accruing in India.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Pride Foramer S.A., a French offshore oil drilling company, which experienced a lull in active contracts between 1993 and 1999. During this interim, despite operating from foreign offices and having no active projects, the company engaged in business correspondence, submitted bids, incurred various business-related expenses, and claimed deductions for these along with unabsorbed depreciation. The Income Tax Department, however, disallowed these claims, asserting that the company had ceased business operations during this inactive period.</p>\n\n<p>Reversing the High Court's decision, the Supreme Court affirmed the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal's view, distinguishing a \"lull\" from a \"cessation\" of business. The Court emphasized that a company's continuous intent and efforts to secure future contracts, such as submitting bids and maintaining business correspondence, demonstrate ongoing operations, irrespective of immediate contract acquisition. Crucially, the Court clarified that the absence of a permanent establishment or conducting business solely through foreign offices does not absolve a non-resident company from tax liability in India if income accrues or arises within the country. Consequently, the Court allowed the deduction of business expenses under Section 37 and permitted the carry-forward of unabsorbed depreciation under Section 32(2) of the Income Tax Act.</p>\n\n<p>This landmark judgment adopts a pragmatic and modern approach to assessing non-resident companies, reinforcing the principle of \"substance over form.\" It establishes that business continuity and entitlement to tax benefits are determined by a company's overarching conduct and intent, rather than merely by active contract periods or physical presence within India, thereby aligning with globalized trade dynamics.</p>",

    "title": "Lull vs. Cessation: Supreme Court Defines “Carrying on Business” for Non-Residents",
    "description": "<p>In a landmark judgment concerning Pride Foramer S.A. v. Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr., the Supreme Court of India has provided essential clarification on the concept of \"carrying on business\" for non-resident companies. The core issue revolved around whether a non-resident entity, during a period without active contracts or a physical presence in India, could still be considered to be carrying on its business and thus be eligible to claim deductions for business expenditure under Section 37 and carry forward unabsorbed depreciation under Section 32(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This ruling significantly impacts how business continuity is assessed, particularly for project-based industries in a globalized economy.</p>\n\n<p>The appellant, Pride Foramer S.A., a French oil drilling company, had an \"interregnum\" period (1996-2000) after an initial 10-year contract expired in 1993, during which it had no active drilling operations in India. Despite this inactivity, the company maintained business correspondences with ONGC from its offices abroad and submitted a bid for a new oil exploration contract, which it eventually secured in 1998. While the Assessing Officer and CIT (Appeals) disallowed tax benefits, asserting the company was not \"carrying on any business,\" the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) reversed these findings. The ITAT distinguished between a \"temporary lull\" and \"cessation of business,\" recognizing the appellant's ongoing efforts. However, the High Court of Uttarakhand overturned the ITAT, linking \"carrying on business\" to the presence of a permanent office or an active contract in India.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court, overturning the High Court's decision, unequivocally affirmed that the appellant was indeed \"carrying on business\" during the relevant period. The Court emphasized that the company's continuous business correspondences and active bidding for new contracts demonstrated a clear \"intention to carry on business\" from the perspective of a prudent businessman, constituting a \"lull in business\" rather than a complete cessation. Crucially, the Supreme Court declared the High Court's linkage of \"carrying on business\" with the existence of a \"permanent establishment\" (PE) as \"wholly fallacious.\" It clarified that while a PE is relevant for Double Tax Avoidance Agreements (DTAA), it is not a mandatory prerequisite under Indian tax law for a non-resident to be deemed as carrying on business and thus liable for tax on income from a \"business connection in India.\" The Court further noted that the High Court's restrictive view was \"wholly anachronistic\" in the contemporary era of globalization and contrary to the principle of \"ease of doing business.\"</p>\n\n<p>This judgment provides much-needed clarity, adopting a pragmatic and commercially aware approach to tax law. By distinctly separating a temporary business lull from permanent cessation and delinking the concept of \"carrying on business\" from the rigid requirement of a physical \"Permanent Establishment,\" the Supreme Court has set a vital precedent. The decision champions the intention and continuous efforts of an assessee, such as maintaining client relationships and bidding for new work, as integral to business continuity. This aligns Indian tax jurisprudence with global commercial realities, offering significant protection to businesses during unavoidable inactive periods and fostering an environment conducive to international trade and investment.</p>",

    "title": "Family Members Have First Right to Buy Ancestral Property, Says Bombay High Court",
    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court has affirmed the preferential right of family members to purchase ancestral property, particularly when it remains undivided, even if the selling co-parcener transfers their share to an outsider. This significant ruling arose from a dispute involving ancestral agricultural lands in Beed district, Maharashtra, where certain members of a joint Hindu family (Rathod family) sold portions of undivided property to external purchasers without offering it to the other co-parceners (Selukar family). The plaintiffs, the Selukar family, invoked Section 22 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, to assert their right of pre-emption, a claim previously upheld by the Trial Court.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Shailesh P. Brahme's analysis established that the properties were indeed undivided joint family holdings, confirming the plaintiffs and the original sellers as co-parceners. The Court clarified that while Section 22 specifically references Class I heirs, in the context of undivided joint family property, the right of pre-emption extends to all co-parceners sharing a common ancestral interest. A pivotal aspect of the judgment was the ruling that a separate declaration to set aside the sale deeds was not required; title automatically vests in the plaintiffs upon their deposit of the purchase consideration, as per Order XX Rule 14 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The High Court also upheld the lower court's decision to extend the payment timeline, recognizing that appellate proceedings had effectively stayed the original decree. Furthermore, the Court rejected the purchasers' reliance on Section 44 of the Transfer of Property Act, as they had not sought partition.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the High Court dismissed both appeals, thereby confirming the concurrent findings of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court. The plaintiffs were directed to deposit the purchase price, along with 6% simple interest, within ninety days. This decision is crucial as it reinforces the pre-emptive rights of co-parceners in undivided ancestral property, streamlining the process by removing the necessity of first canceling sale deeds and providing clarity on the application of Section 22 in such scenarios. It also highlights the judiciary's discretion to adjust timelines for decree execution when appeals delay proceedings.</p>",

    "title": "Karnataka Domestic Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2025: How Karnataka Plans to Rescue, Register and Retire Domestic Workers with Dignity",
    "description": "<p>The Karnataka Government has introduced the Karnataka Domestic Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2025, an ambitious legislative effort aimed at formalizing the employment of an estimated 10-12 lakh domestic workers across the state. This landmark draft law seeks to elevate domestic work to the status of formal sector employment, providing workers with dignity, social security, and comprehensive welfare benefits. If enacted, Karnataka would become the first major state to legally recognize the home as a regular workplace, ensuring protection for housemaids, cooks, nannies, caregivers, gardeners, and gig helpers.</p>\n\n<p>A cornerstone of the Bill is the mandatory requirement for a written employment agreement, mirroring a state-notified model format. This agreement, detailing wages, hours, leave, and welfare contributions, must supersede any oral or informal understanding, with its absence constituting a punishable offense. Furthermore, all domestic workers, employers, placement agencies, and digital platforms must register on a government portal within thirty days. Workers will receive a three-year renewable certificate with a unique identification number, granting access to benefits, while employers failing to register will be barred from hiring and agencies supplying unregistered workers face prosecution.</p>\n\n<p>The Bill defines \"domestic work\" and \"domestic worker\" broadly, covering all chores in various residential settings and encompassing full-time, part-time, live-in, and migrant staff, including those hired via apps. \"Employer\" extends beyond the primary householder to any adult with ultimate control, establishing joint liability with agencies. Registered workers will gain statutory rights beyond the Minimum Wages Act, including notified minimum wages, overtime pay, a maximum 48-hour work week, weekly days off, annual leave, maternity and paternity benefits, accident compensation, and state-run health coverage. Discrimination based on caste, religion, gender, or language is explicitly outlawed, and practices like confining workers or seizing their phones can lead to charges of illegal confinement.</p>\n\n<p>To finance these provisions, the legislation establishes a tripartite Karnataka State Domestic Workers Social Security and Welfare Board, comprising representatives from government, worker unions, employers, welfare associations, and digital platforms. This Board will administer a dedicated Fund, sustained by registration fees, a periodic five percent welfare cess from employers and agencies, fines, and government grants. The Bill also empowers inspectors, acting as labour-cum-social security officers, to investigate complaints of child employment or sexual exploitation, rescue minors, and demand records, possessing powers akin to a civil court for evidence gathering.</p>\n\n<p>Disputes, excluding sexual harassment cases which fall under the POSH Act, 2013, will be mediated by district-level grievance redress committees, with the option to escalate to the State Board for binding orders and appeals to the Karnataka High Court. The Bill prescribes steep penalties for non-compliance, with escalating fines and imprisonment terms for repeat offenders. Grave offenses like employing children or trafficking women for immoral purposes carry severe non-negotiable minimum prison sentences. Notably, the Bill overrides any existing contract or law offering lower protection, while allowing workers to bargain for better terms and ensuring the co-application of other relevant labour statutes.</p>",

    "title": "Orissa HC: EPC Disputes Can’t Hide Under MSME Statutory Arbitration Umbrella : VR Tank Award Set Aside",
    "description": "<p>The Orissa High Court has delivered a significant judgment, setting clear boundaries for the application of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (MSMED Act) concerning complex Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contracts. In the case of Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Adarsh Nobel Corporation Ltd., the Court quashed a ₹2.43 crore arbitration award that had been issued by the MSME Facilitation Council, Cuttack, against IOCL. The ruling unequivocally states that composite, turnkey \"works contracts,\" such as EPC agreements, fall outside the statutory conciliation and arbitration framework designed for buyers and sellers of goods or services under the MSMED Act.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute originated from a lumpsum EPC contract awarded by IOCL to Adarsh Nobel Corporation Ltd. (ANCL) in November 2017 for a VR storage tank at its Paradip Refinery. Following the abrupt cessation of work by ANCL in June 2018 and subsequent termination by IOCL in early 2019, ANCL registered itself as a small enterprise under the MSMED Act in January 2021, post-termination. It then invoked Section 18 of the Act before the MSME Facilitation Council, which subsequently issued an award directing IOCL to pay ANCL significant compensation and release its bank guarantees.</p>\n\n<p>IOCL challenged this award, ultimately pursuing a constitutional writ petition after withdrawing a Section 34 challenge. The company argued that the Facilitation Council lacked inherent jurisdiction (coram non judice) as a composite works contract is fundamentally distinct from a sale of goods or pure service agreement, and therefore outside the MSMED Act's purview. It further highlighted ANCL's post-termination MSME registration and the contract's unsuitability for the statute. ANCL, conversely, contended that the Act's language was expansive, registration was directory, and an alternative remedy existed.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Sanjeeb K. Panigrahi meticulously examined the tender documents, confirming the contract's nature as a \"textbook EPC\" involving design, engineering, supply, fabrication, civil works, testing, and commissioning. Citing established precedents, the Court held that such composite obligations are sui generis and cannot be artificially bifurcated into goods and services to fit the MSMED Act. The Court further clarified that a tribunal acting without inherent jurisdiction constitutes a classical exception to the alternative remedy rule, making the award \"stillborn\" and invalid from its inception. Consequently, the High Court set aside the award and declared the ongoing execution petition infructuous, while leaving parties free to pursue remedies under general law.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment serves as a critical clarification for MSMEs and larger entities alike. It reiterates that the MSME Facilitation Council is intended for straightforward sale or service disputes, not for complex, performance-oriented EPC claims. For purchasers, especially public sector undertakings, it provides reassurance that works contracts will not be arbitrarily brought under the MSMED Act simply because a counterparty later acquires an MSME registration. The ruling underscores the fundamental principle that jurisdiction is paramount, and an award issued without it is void.</p>",

    "title": "IBC and Homebuyers Protection",
    "description": "<p>The article details the evolving landscape of homebuyers' rights under India's Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). A pivotal 2018 amendment recognized real estate allottees as financial creditors, granting them participation and voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC) during Corporate Insolvency Resolution Processes (CIRP). This move followed significant protests by homebuyers, who were initially excluded from meaningful engagement, leading to earlier regulatory adjustments by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to facilitate their claims. Courts have consistently held that delays in property handover constitute a default under the IBC, necessitating developers to either deliver or return funds.</p>\n\n<p>Despite this progress, the Supreme Court's validation of the 2018 amendment in Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Ltd. v. Union of India (2019) categorized homebuyers as unsecured creditors. This classification has been criticized for limiting their recovery prospects and decision-making power in comparison to secured financial institutions, which typically dominate the CoC. Practical administration reveals ongoing inequities, including the exclusion of homebuyers who fail to file claims on time and a significant disparity in interest rates, with homebuyers receiving a capped 8% per annum while lenders impose much higher rates. Regulatory measures, such as IBBI's Regulation 4-E, further empower project lenders by requiring substantial CoC approval for possession, potentially exacerbating homebuyer suppression.</p>\n\n<p>The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), 2016, complements the IBC by mandating transparency, timely project completion, and offering recourse for delays. However, a deeper integration of these frameworks is needed. Legal scholarship and emerging jurisprudence advocate for elevating homebuyers to secured creditor status, citing their proprietary interest in specific flats and the statutory debt arising from non-delivery under RERA. While innovative judicial solutions like 'Reverse CIRP' have emerged to protect possession rights, a definitive consensus on granting homebuyers secured status remains elusive.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends from 2023-2025 indicate some positive shifts, with the Supreme Court acknowledging verified claims for flat possession and urging the inclusion of unfiled but recorded claims. Nevertheless, systemic challenges persist, fueled by fragmented homebuyer groups, procedural complexities, opaque valuations, and the financial dominance of project lenders. Comprehensive reforms are crucial, including enhancing homebuyers' voting power, legally recognizing their secured status, equalizing interest rates, and empowering regulators to enforce transparency and penalize malfeasance, ultimately ensuring homebuyers' constitutional right to shelter is effectively upheld within the insolvency framework.</p>",

    "title": "Rajasthan HC: Assignment under section 5 SARFAESI survives even if NPA tag quashed, guarantors can’t reopen decade-old ARC deal.",
    "description": "<p>The Rajasthan High Court, Jodhpur Bench, recently delivered a significant ruling affirming that a debt assignment under Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, maintains its validity even if the Non-Performing Asset (NPA) classification, which triggered subsequent enforcement actions, is later quashed. In Harendra Singh Rathore & Ors. v. State Bank of India & Ors., Justice Rekha Borana refused to undo a 2014 debt assignment by SBI to Alchemist Assets Reconstruction Co., emphasizing that invalidating the NPA tag affects only Section 13 enforcement actions, not the independent prior sale of the loan under Section 5.</p>\n\n<p>This decade-long legal battle originated from a ₹24 crore debt incurred by Hotel Gaudavan Pvt. Ltd. in 2008, guaranteed by its director-shareholders. After the account became an NPA and was put up for sale, SBI assigned the debt to Alchemist ARC in 2014. Despite borrowers' attempts to challenge the proceedings through various forums, including a DRT ruling in 2015 that declared the original NPA classification illegal, the debt's ownership remained with the ARC. The guarantors subsequently sought to declare the 2014 assignment void, arguing that the quashing of the NPA rendered all subsequent actions, including the assignment, invalid.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court dismissed the guarantors' petition, primarily citing the principle of res judicata, as identical pleas had been rejected multiple times by various judicial bodies, up to the Supreme Court. The court reiterated that while Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act requires an NPA declaration for enforcement, Section 5, which deals with the transfer of financial assets, does not. Therefore, the 2015 DRT order invalidating the NPA only impacted possession proceedings, not the earlier, distinct assignment deed. Relying on the Supreme Court's ICICI Bank v. Official Liquidator of APS Star Industries judgment, the court affirmed that a debt is an asset transferable by a bank without borrower consent, irrespective of the NPA tag's correctness. The court also noted the availability of alternative statutory remedies for challenging recovery orders.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling provides crucial clarity and reassurance for lenders and Asset Reconstruction Companies. It firmly establishes that a bank's right to assign its loan under Section 5 of the SARFAESI Act is an independent power, not contingent on the ultimate fate of its internal NPA classification or the successful execution of Section 13 enforcement measures. Once a debt is assigned, courts will generally uphold the finality of that contract, strengthening the framework for managing and resolving bad assets within the financial system.</p>",

    "title": "IBC is for genuine roofs, not punters: SC lays down new home-buyer litmus test",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in a landmark ruling on September 12, 2025, significantly redefined the eligibility criteria for home-buyers seeking to initiate corporate insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC). In the case of Mansi Brar Fernandes v. Shubha Sharma & Ors. and connected appeals, a two-Judge Bench distinguished between genuine end-users seeking shelter and speculative investors primarily driven by profit. The Court affirmed that the IBC is a \"remedial shield for sick companies and genuine home-buyers, not a sword for risk-free windfalls.\"</p>\n\n<p>Central to the judgment, the Supreme Court held that buyers who enter into buy-back or assured-return schemes are to be considered \"speculative investors\" and, therefore, cannot trigger corporate insolvency proceedings against developers. This ruling effectively bars individuals treating apartments as financial derivatives from leveraging the IBC for debt recovery. Additionally, the Court addressed the technical objection regarding the 2019 amendment, which mandates collective action by at least 100 allottees (or 10%), setting aside its application on equity grounds where the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had already reserved orders prior to the amendment's enforcement. The bench also issued a comprehensive 12-point charter, directing the Centre and States to fill tribunal vacancies, establish a revival fund, strengthen RERA, and safeguard the constitutional right to shelter.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute originated from cases like Ms. Mansi Brar Fernandes, who invested in flats under an MoU granting the developer a buy-back option at a significantly higher price within a year, and Ms. Sunita Agarwal, who was promised an assured return or a flat. Both, after developers defaulted, sought to invoke IBC under Section 7. The NCLAT had previously reversed NCLT admissions, branding them \"speculative investors.\" The Supreme Court's reasoning highlighted that the IBC's purpose is \"revival-oriented, not a debt-recovery mechanism.\" It established a non-exhaustive checklist for tribunals, examining factors such as the nature of the contract, deviation from RERA model agreements, insistence on usurious interest, and absence of steps towards possession, to identify genuine buyers versus profit-chasers. Applying these, the Court concluded that the appellants were indeed pursuing profit through \"financial derivatives masquerading as real estate\" rather than seeking homes.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the 2019 ordinance requiring collective action, the Court clarified its applicability to pending, non-admitted petitions. However, it emphasized that where an NCLT had already reserved judgment, a buyer could not be expected to comply with an impossible demand, allowing subsequent compliance in appeal to cure the defect on equitable grounds. This comprehensive judgment thus fortifies the insolvency process for its intended purpose: the resurrection of viable projects and the protection of genuine home-buyers. It sends a clear message to investors prioritizing high-yield bets that the IBC is not a private debt-recovery mechanism, redirecting them to alternative legal avenues like RERA, consumer fora, or civil courts for redressal.</p>",

    "title": "Orissa HC slams Cuttack bank for holding back gratuity over a loan guarantee—reaffirms Section 4(6) is the only key to forfeit gratuity dues.",
    "description": "<p>The Orissa High Court, in a Division Bench ruling on September 20, 2025, emphatically reiterated that gratuity can only be forfeited under the precise conditions stipulated in Section 4(6) of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The court admonished the Cuttack Central Cooperative Bank Ltd. for unlawfully withholding a retired employee's gratuity over her role as a personal guarantor for a defaulted loan, underscoring that superannuation does not permit such set-offs.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when a Deputy Manager, who retired in 2010 after superannuation with an unblemished record, was denied her gratuity. The bank justified its action by citing her liability as a guarantor for a loan that later went unpaid. This decision was consistently overturned by the Controlling Authority, the Appellate Authority, and a Single Bench of the Orissa High Court before reaching the Division Bench as a writ appeal.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court dismissed the bank's appeal, emphasizing that Section 4(6) of the Act, which begins with a non-obstante clause, permits forfeiture only to the extent of damage or loss suffered by the employer if the employee was \"terminated\" for a wilful act, omission, or negligence causing such damage. Retirement on superannuation, the court clarified, is the antithesis of termination for misconduct, thus eliminating the statutory trigger for forfeiture. The court further held that introducing a guarantor's civil liability into the Act would constitute an unauthorized judicial expansion of its scope, reinforcing that gratuity is a statutory right earned through service, not a security deposit for credit.</p>\n\n<p>Concluding that three statutory forums had already reached the same conclusion without perversity, irrationality, or exceeding statutory remit, the court found no grounds for interference. This judgment serves as a critical reminder to all employers that the provisions of Section 4(6) of the 1972 Act are the sole gateway for gratuity forfeiture, strictly limited to proven misconduct and not extendable to civil liabilities like loan guarantees. The bank was consequently ordered to release the gratuity forthwith.</p>",

    "title": "Arms Act, 1959: Renewal is the Norm, Refusal the Exception, Rules Madras High Court",
    "description": "<p>The Madras High Court, in a significant ruling by its Madurai Bench, has clarified that while possessing a firearm is a regulated privilege under the Arms Act, 1959, the renewal of an existing licence, especially after peaceful use, should be considered the norm. Refusal of renewal, the Court asserted, must be based on explicit, rational, and case-specific findings, shifting the burden from the applicant to the licensing authority to provide compelling reasons.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment arose from a petition filed by Magudapathi, an ordinary citizen who held a smooth bore gun licence since 2021 for crop protection and sport, which had been routinely renewed once. His application for a second renewal in 2024 was denied by the District Magistrate cum District Collector, Dindigul, solely on the grounds that Magudapathi was facing prosecution under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code for a fatal motor vehicle accident. The Collector deemed this a threat to \"public safety,\" prompting Magudapathi to challenge the decision in the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>Justice G.R. Swaminathan, examining Sections 13, 14, and 15 of the Arms Act, 1959, highlighted Section 15(3), which mandates that a licence \"shall, unless the licensing authority for reasons to be recorded in writing otherwise decides, be renewable.\" The Court emphasized that this provision converts the initial privilege into an expectancy of renewal, which can only be defeated by reasons that meet the standards of Section 14, pertaining to refusal. The High Court found the Collector's justification \"woefully insufficient,\" stating that a prosecution for negligent driving (Section 304A IPC) is distinct from firearm-related misconduct, nor does it indicate an individual is of unsound mind or unfit as per Section 14. Furthermore, the Court reiterated that while alternative remedies exist, it can intervene via writ jurisdiction when an impugned order is patently illegal.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the High Court quashed the Collector's order and directed the renewal of Magudapathi’s gun licence for five years, subject to standard conditions. This ruling serves as a crucial reminder that administrative discretion in weapon licensing tightens once a citizen has demonstrated trustworthy conduct, safeguarding individual expectation and ensuring a principled application of the Arms Act against arbitrary denials based on unrelated criminal proceedings.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Madhya Pradesh High Court, in a landmark decision in Smt. Saroj & Others v. Rajendra Prasad Patel & Others, significantly broadened the interpretation of \"legal representative\" under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The case addressed whether individuals not strictly legal heirs, but demonstrably financially and emotionally dependent on the deceased, are entitled to compensation for a motor accident death. The High Court adopted a liberal and humanitarian approach, emphasizing that the Act is beneficial legislation designed to provide relief to victims and their dependents, transcending the technicalities of personal law.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a motor accident where Ramakant Patel died. His brother's widow, Smt. Saroj, and her daughter filed a claim, asserting that Ramakant had supported them financially and emotionally after her husband's demise. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal rejected their claim, holding that as they were not legally wedded wife or biological child, they could not be legal heirs. However, the High Court overturned this, referencing the Supreme Court's ruling in N. Jayasree v. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Co. Ltd., which states that \"legal representative\" is not confined to legal heirs but includes anyone demonstrating financial dependency, even without a formal marital relationship.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed that evidence clearly showed the deceased supported Smt. Saroj and her daughter, thus qualifying them as dependents and \"legal representatives\" under Section 166 of the Act. This judgment marks a progressive development in accident compensation jurisprudence, acknowledging the evolving social realities where dependency and familial bonds may extend beyond conventional definitions of marriage or heirship. It underscores that substantive justice should prioritize proven dependency and loss over rigid adherence to formal relationships, ensuring the compassionate intent of the Motor Vehicles Act is upheld.</p>",

    "title": "Section 17 or Article 226? Kerala High Court Slams the Door on Writ Route in SARFAESI",
    "description": "<p>The Kerala High Court, through a Division Bench, has unequivocally restated that borrowers cannot bypass the specialized statutory remedy under Section 17 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) by directly filing a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. This ruling emerged from a case involving a ₹16 lakh business loan from Kerala State Cooperative Bank, where a borrower sought the return of physically possessed mortgaged property on mere part-payment.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose after Jishith Kumar defaulted on a loan, leading the bank to classify his account as an NPA and subsequently take physical possession of the mortgaged property under Sections 13 and 14 of the SARFAESI Act. Despite having previously failed to honor a One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme facilitated by an earlier writ petition, the borrower filed a fresh writ, seeking restructuring and immediate release of the asset. A Single Judge initially directed the bank to return possession upon a payment of ₹4 lakh and an instalment plan, which the bank contested as exceeding judicial authority.</p>\n\n<p>The Division Bench, hearing the bank's appeal, meticulously examined the SARFAESI framework and numerous Supreme Court precedents. It concluded that the Single Judge's order effectively rewrote the contract and statute, and that the High Court, exercising writ jurisdiction, could not sit in appeal over a meticulously followed statutory process. The bench emphasized that the proper and sole avenue for the borrower to challenge the bank's actions after possession was taken was under Section 17 before the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT). It dismissed the argument that a bank's informal concession could override substantive statutory rights, affirming that equity follows the law.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the Division Bench set aside the Single Judge's judgment in its entirety and dismissed the writ petition as not maintainable. While reaffirming the judiciary's role in policing its own boundaries and prioritizing statutory discipline over judicial equity, the court clarified that its order does not prevent the borrower from approaching the DRT under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. This decision serves as a critical reminder for borrowers that the High Court is not the first forum for challenging SARFAESI proceedings, reinforcing the legislative intent of swift, non-interventionist recovery mechanisms for financial institutions.</p>",

    "title": "A Breach Too Far: Court Exonerates Insurer After Agricultural Tractor Used for Wedding Procession",
    "description": "<p>A protracted legal battle spanning over two decades, stemming from a 2004 tractor accident, recently concluded with a significant judgment by the Madhya Pradesh High Court. The case centered on the New India Insurance Company's liability when an agricultural tractor, insured solely for farming purposes, was involved in an accident while transporting wedding guests (Baratis), resulting in injuries to two pedestrians.</p>\n\n<p>The incident occurred on May 29, 2004, when a speeding tractor collided with Shivram Chaudhary and Sukhlal Chaudhary, causing various injuries. The 3rd Additional Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal initially awarded compensation of ₹30,000 to Shivram and ₹10,000 to Sukhlal, directing the insurer to pay with the liberty to recover the amount from the vehicle's owner and driver (a \"pay and recover\" order).</p>\n\n<p>Aggrieved by the tribunal's decision, three appeals were filed: Shivram Chaudhary sought enhanced compensation, while the insurance company challenged its liability entirely. The insurer argued a fundamental breach of policy terms, citing that the tractor, insured for agricultural use, was illegally transporting passengers. Furthermore, the driver allegedly lacked a valid license. The claimants contended the awarded compensation was insufficient given their sustained injuries and economic losses.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court, after meticulous examination, sided with the insurance company. It emphasized that the tractor's use for carrying wedding guests constituted a clear and fundamental deviation from its insured purpose, altering the risk profile significantly. Citing Supreme Court precedents, the court affirmed that insurers are not liable when vehicles are used in direct violation of core policy conditions, particularly when carrying unauthorized passengers. Consequently, the \"pay and recover\" doctrine was deemed inapplicable in this instance due to the deliberate and fundamental nature of the policy breach.</p>\n\n<p>While exonerating the insurance company, the High Court acknowledged the inadequacy of Shivram Chaudhary's original compensation. It enhanced his award to ₹50,000, factoring in his physical pain, medical expenses, and long-term impact on his livelihood. The final judgment directed the owner and driver of the tractor to jointly and severally deposit the full compensation amount, including the enhanced sum and interest, within 30 days. The insurance company was relieved of all liability, with provisions for refunding any amounts already deposited and recovering any sums paid to the claimant from the owner and driver.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In Sugra Adiwasi & Ors. v. Pathranand & Ors., the Supreme Court of India examined the intersection of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) and the Forest Conservation Act (FCA) concerning the construction of permanent housing for forest dwellers. The court acknowledged the conflict between recognizing the rights of tribal communities to adequate housing and the need to preserve forest ecology.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a dispute over whether forest dwellers could construct permanent homes on forest land without violating the FCA. Petitioners argued the FRA grants habitation rights, including durable housing, while the Union of India emphasized the FCA's role in forest preservation. The core legal issue was whether FRA-recognized construction could proceed despite FCA regulations.</p>\n\n<p>The Court analyzed both Acts, noting the FRA's limited \"notwithstanding\" clause doesn't explicitly authorize housing construction without FCA oversight. It reaffirmed that the FCA regulates, rather than prohibits, non-forest activities, emphasizing forest protection as a constitutional obligation. The court stressed the need for a \"convergent interpretation\" where both statutes coexist, protecting human and environmental interests.</p>\n\n<p>Acknowledging the State's duty to ensure minimum living conditions, the Supreme Court directed the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs to formulate a regulatory mechanism enabling dwelling construction for forest dwellers, ensuring FCA compliance. This directive emphasizes inter-departmental coordination and a balanced approach, reflecting a commitment to both social justice and environmental stewardship.</p>",

The court dismissed the wife's appeal, emphasizing that a consistent pattern of false allegations, unsubstantiated criminal complaints, and vindictive litigation constitutes sufficient grounds for divorce due to the mental anguish inflicted on the other spouse.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a marriage marred by extensive litigation, with the wife initiating numerous complaints, including those under Section 498A of the IPC and the Domestic Violence Act, most of which were later found to be baseless. The Family Court initially granted the divorce, citing the severe mental agony and social humiliation suffered by the husband due to the wife's actions.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court's decision highlighted that mental cruelty encompasses not only physical harm but also emotional distress caused by repeated baseless accusations, character assassination, and the misuse of legal provisions. While \"irretrievable breakdown of marriage\" is not a statutory ground for divorce, the court acknowledged that prolonged separation and loss of trust, in conjunction with demonstrated cruelty, support the dissolution of marriage. The judgment serves as a significant precedent, urging courts to recognize the psychological impact of relentless litigation and ensuring that legal remedies are not weaponized for personal vendettas within matrimonial disputes.</p>",

The court emphasized that the statutory timelines mandated by Section 17(5) of the Act must be strictly adhered to by Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs).</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a borrower's application under Section 17(1) of the SARFAESI Act, which remained pending before the DRT, Dehradun, for an extended period without any extension orders or recorded reasons. The Supreme Court underscored that Section 17(5) requires DRTs to dispose of such applications within 60 days, extendable by a maximum of four months with written justification for each extension. The Court criticized the High Court's previous order for not enforcing the timeline.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court directed the DRT, Dehradun, to immediately comply with Section 17(5) of the SARFAESI Act and dispose of the pending application expeditiously. This ruling serves as a reminder to all DRTs that the statutory timelines are not merely suggestive but are crucial for ensuring timely debt recovery and adjudication of borrower grievances, thereby reinforcing the importance of time in commercial matters.</p>",

Commissioner, Meerut Division & Anr., clarified the classification of instruments for stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. The Court ruled that when a party executes a deed to secure its own obligations, it is classified as a mortgage deed under Article 40, regardless of being titled a \"Security Bond cum Mortgage Deed.\" This is based on the principle that the substance of the transaction prevails over its form.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a dispute where M/s Godwin Construction Pvt. Ltd. executed a \"Security Bond cum Mortgage Deed\" to the Meerut Development Authority (MDA) to secure development obligations, paying stamp duty under the \"Security Bond\" category. Authorities later deemed it a mortgage deed, demanding additional stamp duty. The Supreme Court, upholding lower court decisions, emphasized that Article 57 (Security Bond) applies only when a third-party surety guarantees another's obligations, as per Section 126 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Because the developer mortgaged its own property and no surety was involved, Article 40 (Mortgage Deed) was deemed applicable.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment reinforces that the true legal character of a document is determined by its operative terms and recitals, not merely its title. Where a party mortgages their own property to secure obligations, it constitutes a mortgage deed. This ruling offers clarity for developers, lenders, and authorities, minimizing ambiguity and ensuring consistent stamp duty assessment in real estate and financing transactions. It also underscores the importance of precise legal language in security documents to avoid future disputes.</p>",

    "title": "Understanding the Greenhouse Gases Emission Intensity Target Rules, 2025: A Comprehensive Overview",
    "description": "<p>The Greenhouse Gases Emission Intensity Target Rules, 2025, introduced by the Indian government, aim to curb greenhouse gas emissions across key industrial sectors. Aligned with frameworks like the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, these rules enforce emission reduction targets by focusing on emission intensity, promoting efficiency improvements without hindering economic growth. The rules provide comprehensive definitions, including terms like \"banked\" carbon credits, \"compliance year,\" and specific measurements for \"greenhouse gases emission intensity targets.\" Definitions also reference related legislation like the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023, ensuring consistency across environmental policies.</p>\n\n<p>The rules establish specific emission intensity targets for sectors like Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, and Pulp and Paper. These targets, outlined in the Schedule, provide a trajectory for emission intensity reductions. For instance, entities in the Aluminium sector face baseline GHG emission intensities with specific reduction targets for subsequent years. This structured approach fosters accountability and progress tracking.</p>\n\n<p>Obligated entities must achieve the emission intensity targets specified in the Schedule. Shortfalls require entities to surrender banked carbon credit certificates or purchase new ones. Registration on the designated portal under the Indian Carbon Market Framework and submission of required documentation are also mandatory. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency manages the issuance of carbon credit certificates, providing an incentive for emission reductions. The number of certificates issued is based on the difference between achieved and target emission intensities, multiplied by production units. Entities can bank these certificates for future use.</p>\n\n<p>Environmental compensation is imposed on obligated entities failing to meet the requirements. The Central Pollution Control Board sets the compensation at twice the average price of carbon credit certificates traded during the relevant compliance year's trading cycle. Payment must be made within 90 days, with additional penalties under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 for non-compliance. Collected funds are used for initiatives aligned with the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Greenhouse Gases Emission Intensity Target Rules, 2025, offer a framework for reducing emissions in India, balancing regulatory stringency with practical implementation. Effective enforcement and stakeholder collaboration are critical to achieving national and international environmental goals.</p>",

This decision underscores the accountability of e-commerce platforms in ensuring accurate product delivery and transparent refund processes, emphasizing that internal \"Use Policy\" disclaimers cannot supersede consumer protections under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when Mr. Harjas Singh Sodhi ordered an HP Pavilion laptop from Amazon (sold by Appario Retail) but received an old IBM ThinkPad instead.

The ruling emphasizes that the relief granted in Kedar Nath Yadav v.

While the High Court allowed the petition, the Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that the remedy in Kedar Nath Yadav was specifically for disadvantaged farmers and not for commercial entities.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Santi Ceramics but granted limited relief regarding its factory structures and machinery. This judgment reinforces that judicial directions aimed at protecting vulnerable sections cannot be expanded to include commercial entities that benefited from the acquisition process. It underscores the distinction between public welfare remedies and private commercial claims, while upholding principles of waiver, estoppel, and finality in acquisition proceedings.</p>",

These guidelines aim to establish a zero-tolerance ecosystem, shifting the perception of fraud from an operational risk to a strategic threat requiring proactive involvement from all stakeholders, including insurers, intermediaries, and related entities.</p>\n\n<p>The new framework repeals the 2013 guidelines and applies to all insurers and distribution channels, unless specifically exempted. It tightens definitions of \"insurance fraud\" and introduces concepts like \"red-flag indicators\" and \"cyber or new-age fraud.\" A standardized five-category taxonomy for classifying fraud (internal, distribution-channel, policy-holder/claims, external, and affinity/complex) is established for consistent reporting to the board and IRDAI, enabling industry-wide heat map creation.</p>\n\n<p>At the core of the regime is the Fraud Risk Management Framework, requiring a board-approved, entity-specific set of controls reviewed annually. This framework must include an anti-fraud policy, detailed procedures, defined turnaround times, designated responsible officers, and whistleblower protections. A dedicated Fraud Monitoring Unit is mandated, along with missed-detection reviews. The Fraud Monitoring Committee, composed of key management personnel, will oversee the framework's day-to-day operation, recommending controls, responding to suspicions, maintaining evidence, sharing intelligence, and conducting annual risk assessments.</p>\n\n<p>The guidelines emphasize scientific risk identification, requiring insurers to build libraries of red-flag indicators and incorporate them into workflows. Category-specific controls must address each fraud bucket. A central database of convicted or attempted fraudsters is to be maintained. Cyber fraud receives special attention, necessitating robust cybersecurity architectures and multi-factor customer authentication. The Insurance Information Bureau is designated as the industry's fraud intelligence hub, collecting data from insurers and providing real-time alerts.</p>\n\n<p>Re-insurers, both Indian and foreign, must adhere to the stricter of their home jurisdiction's anti-fraud standards or the IRDAI guidelines.

Drawing upon the Supreme Court’s ruling in Barun Chandra Thakur vs Master Bholu (2022), the High Court stressed that the assessment demands a careful and individualized approach, examining the child’s physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. The court reinforced the principle that maturity is a developmental process, and juveniles are particularly vulnerable to impulsivity and external factors.</p>\n\n<p>While the statute states that the Board \"may\" seek assistance from psychologists or psychosocial workers, the High Court mandated that such assistance should be compulsory unless the Board includes a qualified child psychologist or psychiatrist.

This framework aims to balance technological innovation with regulatory oversight, ensuring transparency, auditability, and accountability in algorithmic trading and intermediary functions. The initiative is part of SEBI's broader Enhanced Supervision Programme, designed to strengthen technology governance and systemic risk management.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, SEBI directed all recognised exchanges to establish a uniform supervisory framework for tracking AI/ML systems used by intermediaries. The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) implemented this through half-yearly reporting obligations, requiring members to disclose details of AI/ML systems used for trading, risk management, or investor servicing, even mandating NIL declarations for those not using such systems. In 2023, the reporting framework was broadened to include predictive, analytical, and pattern-recognition algorithms used across various functions, with greater emphasis on auditability and documentation.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) introduced a cross-exchange reporting mechanism, allowing trading members registered with NSE to make a single AI/ML disclosure filing shared with other exchanges. This harmonised model, adopted by MSE, reduces duplication and simplifies compliance for multi-exchange firms. The framework mandates that all algorithmic trading members report the use of AI/ML systems, whether developed in-house or procured from third-party vendors, and maintain comprehensive documentation for supervisory reviews. SEBI's approach emphasizes technological neutrality with regulatory accountability, ensuring that AI/ML tools operate within parameters that protect market integrity and investor trust.</p>",

The Court clarified that this regulation can only be exercised to prevent profiteering, commercialization, or capitation fees, ensuring that collected fees are exclusively used for educational purposes, as mandated by the Delhi School Education Act, 1973 (DSEA) and the Delhi School Education Rules, 1973 (DSER).</p>\n\n<p>The judgment, delivered by a Division Bench, reaffirms the autonomy of private unaided institutions while protecting against exploitation.

The University's Unfair Means Committee recommended their expulsion, which the Vice Chancellor approved. The students argued that permanent expulsion was excessively harsh and violated their fundamental rights, especially considering the discretionary powers available to the Vice Chancellor under the University Statute. They referenced precedents emphasizing proportionality in punishment and advocating for a reformative approach to discipline.</p>\n\n<p>The University defended its decision, citing the severity of impersonation and the need to maintain academic credibility. They argued that the \"Rules for Unfair Means\" were properly implemented and that students were bound by the University's disciplinary jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court held that while it respects academic autonomy, it can intervene in cases of arbitrary or disproportionate punishment. Justice Sinha found that the Vice Chancellor had mechanically accepted the Committee's recommendation without independent reasoning. The Court emphasized that permanent expulsion was excessively harsh for first-time offenders, preventing any chance of reform. Consequently, the court modified the punishments, emphasizing that this leniency should not be mistaken for condoning the misconduct.

This private member's bill seeks to legally recognize an employee's right to disconnect from work-related communications after hours, mirroring similar initiatives in European countries.</p>\n\n<p>The bill arises from increasing employee burnout and the \"always-on\" work culture, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It aims to provide statutory protections, ensuring employees can disengage without fear of retaliation. Key provisions include defining the \"Right to Disconnect,\" prohibiting punitive actions against employees who exercise this right, establishing grievance redressal committees, and enabling the Labour Commissioner to enforce compliance.</p>\n\n<p>The bill aligns with the Indian Constitution, particularly Article 21, which guarantees the right to life with dignity, and Articles 38, 39, and 43, which mandate humane working conditions. It addresses the statutory gap in existing labor laws concerning digital extension of labor beyond physical working hours. While facing challenges in enforceability and requiring consideration for sectoral flexibility, the bill catalyzes crucial discussions on redefining workplace rights in the digital age.</p>",

    "title": "Food Safety or Competition Issue? CCI Draws the Line in Maggi Sauce Case",
    "description": "<p>The Competition Commission of India (CCI) dismissed a complaint against Nestle India Limited concerning alleged use of contaminated water in the production of Maggi Sauce at its Goa factory. The complaint, filed by Sarvesh M. Kolumbkar, accused Nestle of violating the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and abusing its dominant position under Section 4 of the Competition Act. The informant sought an investigation into a purported \"Maggi Sauce scam\" and requested interim relief.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI found no prima facie contravention of the Competition Act, clarifying that the allegations centered on food safety, hygiene, and product labelling, issues under the jurisdiction of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The Commission emphasized that the alleged use of dirty water and mislabelling did not constitute anti-competitive practices or demonstrate that Nestle exploited its market position to restrict competitors or harm consumers.</p>\n\n<p>The decision reinforces that unethical business practices do not automatically equate to abuse of dominance unless they directly impact market competition. The CCI underscored its role in ensuring market fairness and efficiency, distinct from addressing general consumer grievances or regulatory non-compliance related to food safety. The order clarifies the boundary between competition law and sectoral regulation, directing concerns regarding public health, product contamination, or deceptive labelling to appropriate authorities like the FSSAI.</p>",
