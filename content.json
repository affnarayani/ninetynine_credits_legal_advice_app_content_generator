    "title": "CCI Dismisses Allegations Against BSNL: Tender Disqualification Not Anti-Competitive",
    "description": "<p>The Competition Commission of India (CCI) addressed a case filed by M/s C.C.L. Optoelectronics Private Ltd. against Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (BSNL), alleging abuse of dominant position under Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002. The informant contested BSNL's disqualification of its bid for a tender concerning Splice Closures for Optical Fiber Cables, arguing that the tender conditions were discriminatory and favored certain bidders.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI, upon examination, defined the relevant market as Telecommunication Services in India. It found that BSNL's market share (approximately 2.09%) was significantly smaller than those of its major competitors, such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. The commission concluded that BSNL did not hold a dominant position. It also noted that the disqualification was based on past performance criteria, not turnover.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the CCI determined that no prima facie case of contravention of Section 4 of the Act was established against BSNL. The Commission closed the matter under Section 26(2) of the Competition Act, 2002, dismissing the application for interim relief and concluding that BSNL's actions did not constitute abuse of dominance or restrictive trade practices.</p>",

    "title": "Arbitral Award Must Be Within the Parameters of the Agreement Between the Parties",
    "description": "<p>Arbitration is rooted in party autonomy, where consent forms the basis of the tribunal's jurisdiction, scope, and authority. An arbitral award must adhere to the contract's parameters; deviations, either by disregarding terms or granting inconsistent relief, undermine the agreement's sanctity and the tribunal's jurisdiction, making the award vulnerable under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>\n\n<p>The Indian arbitration framework, particularly Section 28(3) of the Act, emphasizes contractual sanctity, mandating tribunals to decide per the contract's terms. Arbitrators interpret, but do not rewrite, contracts based on equity or fairness. The Supreme Court of India has consistently reinforced that tribunals are creations of the contract, unable to exceed their mandate. Awards violating express terms are deemed patently illegal and against public policy.</p>\n\n<p>Evidentiary discipline and procedural adherence are crucial, especially concerning contractual preconditions like notices or written approvals. Tribunals cannot waive these stipulations unless permitted by the contract. The Supreme Court has reinforced that commercial fairness cannot override contractual discipline, as seen in SEPCO Electric Power Construction Corporation vs. GMR Kamalanga Energy Ltd., where the court set aside a tribunal's decision for wrongly invoking equitable estoppel to overlook mandatory contractual notices.</p>\n\n<p>Judicial review under Sections 34 and 37 serves as a safeguard against arbitral excess, intervening when awards exhibit patent illegality or violate public policy, ensuring arbitration remains true to party consent. Contracting parties must draft precisely and adhere to performance requirements. Courts assess whether awards respect the agreement's boundaries, exercising restraint when faithful interpretations exist and correcting departures.</p>\n\n<p>Arbitration's strength lies in predictability and respect for autonomy. Tribunals upholding the agreement's integrity reinforce commercial certainty. Conversely, exceeding mandates undermines the process. Awards must be rooted in the contract, ensuring arbitration remains an extension of party autonomy governed by the rule of contract.</p>",

    "title": "CCI's Google Play Ruling: Key Insights On Competition Law And Digital Platforms",
    "description": "<p>The Competition Commission of India (CCI) dismissed allegations against Google related to the termination of Liberty Infospace Pvt. Ltd.'s developer account on the Google Play Store. The CCI, acting under Section 26(2) of the Competition Act, 2002, found no prima facie case of contravention. The case arose after Google terminated Liberty Infospace's account, citing violations of Developer Program Policies and association with previously banned accounts. Liberty Infospace alleged abuse of dominant position by Google, claiming unilateral termination and lack of due process.</p>\n\n<p>Liberty Infospace sought investigation, penalties, and structural changes to ensure transparent enforcement of Play Store policies. Google argued that the issue was an individual grievance related to policy enforcement, relying on prior CCI decisions that upheld the legitimacy of Play Store enforcement mechanisms. Google asserted that the enforcement was proportionate and consistent with global standards.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI framed issues to determine if Google abused its dominant position by terminating the account, if the termination had an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC), and if interim relief should be granted. Ultimately, the CCI's order reinforces that competition law intervenes in digital platforms only when market-wide harm, exclusionary conduct, or unfair leveraging is evident. The Commission deemed Google's policy enforcement as reasonable, proportionate, and consistent with global standards, emphasizing that compliance with platform policies is necessary.</p>",

    "title": "Limits on Title Transfer: Supreme Court Clarifies Legal Effect of Agreement to Sell, General Power of Attorney, and Will",
    "description": "<p>In *Ramesh Chand v. Suresh Chand*, the Supreme Court addressed whether an agreement to sell, a general power of attorney (GPA), or a registered will can independently transfer title to immovable property. The Court reinforced that these instruments, particularly a will under suspicious circumstances, cannot establish title without strict legal proof. This decision solidifies existing jurisprudence against informal property transfers.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose between brothers over inherited property. One brother claimed ownership based on an agreement to sell, GPA, affidavit, and registered will, while the other contested the documents' validity. The Supreme Court, referencing prior rulings like *Suraj Lamp*, reiterated that under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, an agreement to sell only grants a right to enforce specific performance, not ownership. A GPA is an agency instrument, not a conveyance, and requires explicit transfer language to pass title.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized that a registered will is not self-proving and requires rigorous proof under the Indian Succession Act and Evidence Act. This includes attestation by two witnesses, with at least one testifying. In this case, the will, favoring one son without explanation and lacking examined attesting witnesses, was deemed unproven. The Supreme Court affirmed that while this ruling introduces no new doctrine, it underscores the need for proper conveyancing and heightened legal awareness in familial property matters where informal documents are often used to effect property transfers.</p>",

    "title": "Devolution of Self-Acquired Property under Pre-1956 Mitakshara Law: Exclusive Succession of Male Issue Affirmed",
    "description": "<p>The High Court of Kerala addressed the devolution of a Hindu male's self-acquired property under the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law before the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The ruling affirms the principle that male issue exclusively succeeded to the separate property of the father if the death occurred prior to the Act's commencement, prioritizing the male line in succession and excluding daughters when a son was present.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a dismissed partition suit where the appellants, legal heirs of Rama Pai's daughter, contested a 1965 sale of Rama Pai's self-acquired property by his son, Hari Pai. The appellants argued that the property should have devolved jointly upon Hari Pai and Rama Pai's daughter. The respondents countered that Rama Pai died before 1956, making his son the sole heir. The court upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that Rama Pai had died before 17.06.1956 based on the unchallenged oral testimony of a witness stating the death occurred in 1950.</p>\n\n<p>The court rejected the appellant's reliance on the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, 1929, noting that it only introduced a limited set of female heirs and did not confer on a daughter the same status as a son when a son was present. Under the Mitakshara law applicable before 1956, the self-acquired property of a male devolved exclusively upon his male issue. This principle was supported by authoritative precedents.</p>\n\n<p>The Court concluded that since Rama Pai died before 1956, his self-acquired property devolved entirely upon his son, Hari Pai, who validly conveyed his rights to the defendants. Consequently, the court dismissed the appeal, upholding the judgment that the property was not partible. The decision restates the legal position concerning inheritance rights under the Mitakshara law before the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench, in Parvati Swati v. Vyankat & Anr., reaffirmed a mother's right to custody following the father's death, emphasizing the paramount importance of the child's welfare under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. The ruling underscores that while grandparents can provide love, the mother, as the natural guardian, holds the inherent right and responsibility unless proven unfit.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose after the father's death, where the paternal grandparents sought guardianship of the minor child, whose custody had been granted to the father in a prior divorce decree. The mother filed a counter-application seeking custody, which was initially rejected. The High Court addressed whether the grandparents could claim custody in preference to the mother, citing Section 6(a) of the Act, which favors the mother as the natural guardian after the father's death, especially for children below five.</p>\n\n<p>The Court considered arguments from both sides, including the mother's improved financial stability and the child's established relationship with the grandparents. Justice Chapalgaonkar, reiterating the child's welfare as paramount, ruled in favor of the mother, citing precedents that a natural parent's custody should only be denied if they are demonstrably unfit. The Court granted custody to the mother while providing visitation rights to the grandparents, balancing the child's legal right to maternal care with the importance of maintaining family bonds. This judgment reaffirms the principle that a mother's care is irreplaceable while emphasizing the need for compassion and justice in guardianship law.</p>",

This draft aims to establish a unified, principle-based framework for transactions between regulated entities (REs) and their related parties, an area of long-standing concern regarding governance and prudential oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, regulations on lending to related parties are fragmented across various regulatory frameworks, leading to potential arbitrage and ambiguity. The new draft directions intend to harmonize governance standards, enhance transparency in related-party exposures, and strengthen market discipline across all REs, including banks, NBFCs, and cooperative banks.</p>\n\n<p>Key provisions include a broad definition of \"related parties\" aligned with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS 24), materiality-based thresholds for Board or committee approval of transactions, and a principle-based exemption to Section 20(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The draft also mandates comprehensive reporting and disclosure obligations to align with international best practices.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed framework emphasizes ethical governance and conflict of interest management, requiring financial institutions to embed robust governance and risk management practices. Non-compliance may lead to regulatory action and reputational consequences. This initiative, part of broader reforms promoting uniformity and sound corporate governance, follows the Final Co-Lending Framework. The RBI invites stakeholder feedback before finalizing the directions, which will supersede existing circulars.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Draft Lending to Related Parties Directions, 2025, represent a crucial step toward promoting integrity, transparency, and uniform governance in India's financial system, balancing operational flexibility with prudential discipline to enhance resilience and credibility.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Allahabad High Court, in Suresh Chandra Singh Negi and Another v. Bank of Baroda and Others, addressed the liability of banks in cases of alleged unauthorized electronic transactions, specifically when the customer's credentials and devices were used. The court examined the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s 2017 Circular on customer protection and clarified the extent of customer and bank liability in digital banking operations.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved petitioners claiming unauthorized transfers from their accounts despite using internet banking facilities. They argued cyber fraud, citing a blocked SIM card preventing OTP receipt, and relied on the RBI circular mandating banks to restore debited amounts if notified within three days. The Bank of Baroda, however, presented evidence showing the transactions were initiated by the petitioners themselves using their login credentials, registered devices, and OTPs, with a password change following the transfers.</p>\n\n<p>The Allahabad High Court found that the evidence indicated the transactions were carried out by the petitioners, noting the use of their login, OTPs, and the addition of beneficiaries. The court also highlighted the delay in reporting the issue as inconsistent with genuine cyber fraud victims. Analysis of the RBI circular revealed that while the bank bears the burden of proof, the Bank of Baroda successfully demonstrated customer liability. The court also distinguished precedents cited by the petitioners, noting that those cases involved third-party fraud and prompt reporting, unlike the present case.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the court ruled there was no unauthorized withdrawal and dismissed the petition, emphasizing that the RBI circular protects genuine cyber fraud victims, not those attempting to escape consequences of their own negligence. The decision reinforces that digital vigilance is a shared responsibility, and liability cannot be shifted to the bank when transactions are executed using the customer\u2019s own credentials.</p>",

The Commission directed the builder to hand over possession of the flat within two months and provide compensation for mental agony and litigation expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when the complainants, having paid 95% of the total sale consideration for a flat in \u201cThe Jewel of Noida,\u201d received a demand for an additional \u20b915,25,120 towards Service Tax and GST, which was not indicated in the original agreement.

It also found the builder's demand for additional taxes to be without legal or contractual basis, constituting a deficiency in service and an unfair trade practice.

    "description": "<p>The National Commodity Clearing Limited (NCCL) has issued a circular directing members to comply with the amended Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). This underscores the importance of protecting consumers from Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC) and the responsibilities of corporations in managing mass communications.</p>\n\n<p>The TCCCPR, grounded in the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997, aims to regulate commercial communications and empower consumers to control the messages they receive. Recent amendments prohibit the use of standard 10-digit mobile numbers for commercial communications, mandating the use of designated 1600-series numbers for transactional and service-related messages to enhance traceability and oversight.</p>\n\n<p>NCCL's circular emphasizes the need for corporates to whitelist URLs, mobile applications, and digital assets used in communications, as well as ensuring that SIP/PRI connections comply with TCCCPR standards. Cooperation with the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) and TRAI is also crucial, requiring companies to report and respond to advisories, integrating cybersecurity, consumer protection, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Non-compliance can lead to monetary penalties, blocked communication channels, and restrictions on services, as well as potential liabilities under the Information Technology Act, 2000, related to unauthorized access and cyber fraud. Reputational risks and loss of customer trust are also significant concerns. Therefore, corporate legal and compliance teams must integrate TCCCPR compliance into standard operating procedures, including regular audits, whitelisting tools, adherence to 1600-series numbers, and comprehensive staff training.</p>\n\n<p>The NCCL circular indicates a broader regulatory trend in India towards stricter consumer protection and digital security in corporate communications. By proactively aligning systems with TRAI's amendments, businesses can mitigate legal and operational risks, while strengthening consumer trust. Compliance must be a core component of operational strategy to protect consumers, uphold corporate integrity, and avoid regulatory and reputational fallout.</p>",

Anand Distilleries and its Directors, following the dishonoring of a cheque issued as security for a loan. The hospital had extended a loan to the company, receiving a post-dated cheque as security. After periodic interest payments ceased, the hospital learned of insolvency proceedings initiated against M/s. Anand Distilleries under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IB Code).</p>\n\n<p>Despite the insolvency proceedings, the respondents requested that the cheque be presented, which was subsequently dishonored due to insufficient funds. A legal notice was issued, followed by a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (NI Act), and Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The trial court discharged the respondents from the Section 138 NI Act offense, citing the ongoing insolvency proceedings, leading to the hospital challenging this discharge order in the Bombay High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The central issue before the High Court was whether the initiation of insolvency proceedings under the IB Code prior to the filing of a complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act nullifies the latter proceedings. The Bombay High Court, referencing relevant Supreme Court judgments, ruled that the trial court had erred in discharging the respondents. The court emphasized that the moratorium for corporate debtors under the IB Code does not extend to the personal criminal liability of directors and individuals under the NI Act. Consequently, the High Court allowed the Criminal Writ Petition, quashing the trial court's orders and reinstating the complaint, reinforcing the principle that personal penal liability persists despite corporate insolvency proceedings.</p>",

The case, stemming from a 1996 agreement for EPL to supply electricity to both GUVNL and ESL, centered on EPL's alleged breach of proportionate allocation by supplying more power to ESL than agreed, leading to claims of wrongful diversion.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute moved through multiple adjudicative bodies, including the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) and the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). Previous rulings had addressed issues such as capacity declaration, compensation for diversion, and the appropriate methodology for computing the diverted electricity. The Supreme Court's intervention became necessary to settle the matter.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of adhering to its 2016 decision, which established the proportionate allocation obligation and capacity declaration requirement under the PPA. A key aspect of the judgment was the entitlement of GUVNL to reimbursement of fixed charges for electricity diverted to ESL, distinct from compensation for diversion. The court also upheld the GERC's methodology for computing electricity diversion, using hourly periods until February 23, 2005, and half-hourly periods thereafter, acknowledging a subsequent consensual change implemented by both parties. Additionally, the court affirmed the method of calculating compensation for wrongful diversion, which is based on the HTP-1 Tariff Energy Charge rate reduced by variable costs. The Supreme Court upheld APTEL's decision to remand specific issues, such as discrepancies in Deemed Generation Incentive amounts, to GERC for further factual examination and determination. The ruling directed GUVNL to receive reimbursement of fixed charges and compensation for wrongful diversion, following the specified computation methodologies, and instructed each party to bear its own costs.</p>",

    "title": "The Minor Husband Maintenance Ruling: Allahabad High Court's Judgement Summary",
    "description": "<p>This case summary details a recent ruling by the Allahabad High Court regarding maintenance claims under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The central issue concerned a wife and minor daughter seeking maintenance from a husband who was a minor at the time of the application but attained majority during the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>The Family Court initially granted the maintenance, but the husband challenged the order, citing his minority at the time of filing. The High Court, however, clarified that while maintenance liability could not arise before the husband's majority, it became applicable upon attaining majority. The court considered evidence of cruelty and neglect by the husband, justifying the wife's refusal to cohabit. Assessing the husband's income based on his labor capacity within a joint Hindu family, the court deemed the initial maintenance amount excessive, referencing Supreme Court precedents such as Rajnesh vs. Neha.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the High Court partly allowed the revision, reducing the maintenance amount to Rs. 2,500 for the wife and Rs. 2,000 for the daughter, effective from the date the husband attained majority, aligning the allowance with approximately 25% of the assessed income. This judgment underscores that maintenance claims can be sustained despite the husband's initial minority, emphasizing substantive justice, responsibility, and the protection of vulnerable spouses and children. It clarifies that minority does not permanently exempt individuals from future liability when cruelty and neglect are established.</p>",

This advisory addresses growing concerns about delayed submissions that disrupt the flow of foreign contributions to registered entities.</p>\n\n<p>According to FCRA regulations, renewal applications must be submitted electronically using Form FC-3C within six months before the registration certificate's expiry. However, many associations are submitting applications with insufficient time for scrutiny and security clearance, often less than 90 days before expiry.</p>\n\n<p>The consequences of delayed renewal are significant: an association's certificate expires before the renewal is approved, it will be barred from receiving or utilizing foreign funds. To mitigate these risks, the Ministry strongly advises associations to submit renewal applications at least four months before the expiry date, allowing adequate time for administrative review and security clearance. Failure to comply could result in a lapse of registration and a halt to foreign funding.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Kerala High Court recently ruled in R. Suresh Babu v. State Co-operative Election Commission that election officials cannot impose disqualifications beyond those explicitly stated in the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act, 1969 and the Kerala Co-operative Societies Rules, 1969. The case involved the rejection of a nomination for the Neyyattinkara Circle Co-operative Union election based on the rationale that a proposer could not also be a candidate in the same constituency.</p>\n\n<p>Justice K. Babu overturned the Returning Officer's decision, emphasizing that Rule 129(4) contains no such prohibition and that the right to contest is a statutory right restrictable only by express statutory provisions. The court distinguished between permissible judicial intervention to correct manifest illegality and impermissible disruption of the election process. Referencing Supreme Court precedents like Election Commission v. Ashok Kumar, the court affirmed that intervention is justified when a nomination rejection is patently illegal and requires no detailed evidence.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling reinforces electoral fairness within co-operative institutions by preventing unwarranted assumptions of power by election officials and ensuring that individuals are not denied their statutory right to contest elections based on extraneous grounds. The Kerala High Court underscored that while courts generally avoid mid-election interference, they can intervene when violations are obvious and unfair, thus balancing respect for the electoral process with the need to correct clear wrongdoing and protect democratic rights.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court has raised serious concerns regarding the proposed redevelopment of a 33-acre government-owned land parcel in Cuffe Parade, Mumbai, intended for the rehabilitation of approximately 65,000 slum dwellers. The court's scrutiny stems from allegations that the project, facilitated through the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), effectively transfers public land for private benefit under the guise of welfare.</p>\n\n<p>The Division Bench emphasized the scarcity of public land in Mumbai and the State's fiduciary duty to preserve it as a community resource, citing the doctrine of public trust. The court cautioned against welfare schemes being exploited for private enrichment, labeling the practice a \"usual modus operandi to siphon off valuable public lands.\"</p>\n\n<p>The judgment carries significant implications for governance, urban policy, and constitutional accountability, reinforcing that the State functions as a trustee of public land and must ensure that any transfer demonstrably serves public interest. The court underscored the necessity of obtaining high-level sanction, maintaining transparency, and ensuring public consultation before implementing such large-scale redevelopment schemes. The absence of transparency or due process, the Court cautioned, makes such projects vulnerable to judicial invalidation. The decision calls for a balanced approach between welfare and public interest.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Bombay High Court's remarks serve as a reminder that public assets cannot be disposed of without clear justification, transparency, and constitutional compliance, reinforcing the need for procedural integrity, executive accountability, and transparent governance.</p>",

This notification clarifies the existing provision in the Maharashtra Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 2017, Section 16(1)(b), that allows businesses to operate seven days a week, provided each employee receives a continuous 24-hour weekly rest period.

    "description": "<p>In September 2025, the Delhi High Court concluded a protracted matrimonial dispute originating from a 2006 divorce petition filed in Mumbai. The central issues revolved around the wife's entitlement to half of a \u20b91.09 crore surplus from an auctioned flat, the appropriateness of \u20b92 lakh monthly interim maintenance, and the husband's plea for divorce based on cruelty and desertion. The court's 35-page judgment upheld established family law principles and underscored the continued relevance of fault in Hindu matrimonial law.</p>\n\n<p>The couple married in 1999 and lived in Mumbai due to the husband's job. After the husband left in 2006, the wife moved to Delhi. The husband filed for divorce, which was transferred to Delhi, triggering parallel litigation over maintenance and property rights. A flat purchased jointly during the marriage was auctioned due to default, resulting in the surplus now in dispute. The wife claimed entitlement to half the surplus and contested the interim maintenance amount, while the husband sought to overturn both.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court addressed four appeals collectively. The husband alleged cruelty and desertion based on various incidents, while the wife countered with claims of the husband's relationship with a colleague. The court considered several legal precedents regarding maintenance, cruelty, desertion, and the bar created by Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA). It also invoked the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act.</p>\n\n<p>The court affirmed the \u20b92 lakh monthly maintenance, citing the wife's lack of independent income and the husband's financial capacity. It ruled that the wife was entitled to 50% of the flat's surplus, emphasizing that jointly-owned property is presumed to be held equally unless proven otherwise, and that the Benami Act prevents the husband from claiming sole ownership based on EMI payments. On the divorce petition, the court concurred with the Family Court that the husband did not demonstrate adequate cause for divorce, and the husband's own misconduct barred him from obtaining a decree. The court directed the release of \u20b954.5 lakh to the wife, maintained the maintenance amount, and dismissed the divorce appeal, highlighting the importance of fault and clean hands in Indian matrimonial law and reminding litigants that conduct during and after filing for divorce is relevant.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has ruled that Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) contributions collected by an employer do not become the property of the corporate debtor and must be excluded from the liquidation estate. This decision, delivered on September 24, 2025, in Company Appeal (AT)(Ins) No. 301 of 2024, overturns a prior NCLT order and directs that Rs 1,20,80,940 of ESI dues belonging to Gupta Dyeing & Printing Mills Pvt. Ltd. be kept separate from the assets available to other creditors during liquidation.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose when the Regional Director of ESIC claimed that unpaid ESI contributions, deducted from workers' wages, should be excluded from the company's assets due to a statutory trust under Section 40(4) of the ESI Act, 1948. This claim was challenged by the liquidator and other creditors who would benefit from including the amount in the liquidation estate. The NCLT initially dismissed the ESIC plea, deeming the Corporation an operational creditor without priority under Section 53(1)(b) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).</p>\n\n<p>On appeal, the NCLAT emphasized that employers hold employee ESI contributions as trustees for the ESIC, making non-payment a breach of trust. The tribunal aligned with a previous ruling in Nurani Subramanian Suryanarayanan, Liquidator of M/s Care IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd. v. ESIC, which resolved a similar issue in favor of the Corporation. The NCLAT clarified that Section 36(4)(a)(i) of the IBC carves out \"assets in trust for any third party\" from the liquidation estate, and Section 40(4) of the ESI Act creates precisely such a trust.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT set aside the NCLT order, directing that the ESI dues of Rs 1,20,80,940 be remitted to the ESIC and not treated as part of the liquidation estate. The ruling affirms that social security deductions are distinct and do not merge into the corporate debtor's assets. This decision serves as a reminder to liquidators and reinforces the right of statutory authorities to insist on exclusion rather than mere priority of such deductions. This precedent may influence similar claims related to other wage-related statutes like provident fund and gratuity.</p>",

These directions consolidate and standardize procedures for settling claims related to deposit accounts, safe deposit lockers, and articles in safe custody for deceased bank customers, aiming to minimize delays and ensure uniform practices across commercial and cooperative banks. They do not apply to government-administered savings schemes like PPF or SCSS.</p>\n\n<p>The legal basis for these directions rests on provisions intended to expedite claim settlements. The RBI observed inconsistent bank practices regarding nomination, often requiring succession certificates even with existing nominations. These directions repeal prior circulars, establishing a uniform and enforceable system.</p>\n\n<p>For claims exceeding a specified threshold, settlement necessitates succession certificates, legal heir certificates, or affidavits, potentially with sureties. Banks retain discretion to act on uncontested Wills without requiring probate but require court orders for disputed claims. In the absence of a nomination, a simplified procedure involves claim forms, death certificates, identity proof, and a legal heir certificate or affidavit with no-objection statements from other heirs. Disputed cases without nomination require probate, succession certificate, or a court order for resolution.</p>\n\n<p>These Directions represent a significant reform in banking consumer protection law, establishing uniform procedures, timelines, and penalties for delays. They address long-standing grievances by depositor families, ensuring efficient access to funds and belongings while balancing ease of settlement with safeguards against wrongful claims. The harmonized framework enhances operational clarity for banks and strengthens customer trust in the banking system.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In Sharad Singh v. H. D. Narang, the Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark judgment enhancing the compensation awarded to the legal representative of a deceased accident victim, Sharad Singh, who suffered paraplegia due to a motor vehicle accident. The ruling, authored by Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice N.V. Anjaria, refines motor accident compensation jurisprudence, particularly concerning students with demonstrated academic potential.</p>\n\n<p>The victim, a 20-year-old B. Com student and ICAI enrollee, sustained severe injuries in 2001 when a negligently driven car struck the motorcycle he was riding, resulting in complete paraplegia. He remained bedridden until his death in 2021. The Supreme Court addressed the High Court's inadequate assessment of income and future medical expenses. It dismissed the insurance company's objections to medical bills from hospitals outside the victim's hometown, emphasizing the company's national presence and the legitimate need for specialized care in different locations.  The Court upheld medical expenses amounting to Rs. 20 lakhs, recognizing the necessity of the treatments for sustaining the victim's life.</p>\n\n<p>Critically, the Court rejected the lower courts' reliance on minimum wage as the basis for calculating loss of income. The Supreme Court deemed the use of minimum wage inappropriate for a graduate student pursuing a Chartered Accountancy qualification. Instead, it estimated a notional monthly income of Rs. 5,000 in 2001, considering his potential as an accountant, and applied a 40% increase for future prospects, consistent with National Insurance Company Limited vs. Pranay Sethi and Others. This led to a revised loss of income calculation of Rs. 15,12,000.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's judgment resulted in a significantly enhanced total compensation award of Rs. 40,34,356. The Court underscored the importance of considering a student's potential when determining compensation and reiterated that insurance companies cannot evade liability on unsubstantiated grounds, especially when life-saving medical care is involved. The ruling serves as a precedent for equitable compensation, acknowledging both the victim's potential and the substantial costs associated with life-sustaining care.</p>",

The case involved parents who, after their son's death in a workplace accident, received Rs 10 lakh through a Lok Adalat settlement and later sought additional compensation from the Employees\u2019 Compensation Commissioner.</p>\n\n<p>The Commissioner denied the claim, citing the prior Lok Adalat award as a final discharge of liability. The parents appealed this decision, leading the High Court to formulate two substantial questions of law: whether the Employees\u2019 Compensation Act claim can be settled through a Pre-Litigation Petition despite Section 8(1) of the EC Act, and whether receipt of money from the Lok Adalat bars a subsequent claim for the statutory amount before the Commissioner.</p>\n\n<p>The Court, referencing the supremacy clause in Section 25 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, ruled that the Lok Adalat settlement was final. It reasoned that when a dispute is taken to a Permanent Lok Adalat, the restrictions of Section 8(1) are relaxed, given the Adalat's role in protecting weaker parties. The court also invoked the doctrine of election of remedies, stating that the parents, having chosen to settle at the Lok Adalat, were bound by that choice. Thus, the appeal was dismissed, affirming that the Rs 10 lakh already received constituted a full and conclusive settlement, preventing the family from pursuing further compensation through the Employees\u2019 Compensation Commissioner.</p>",

The court ruled that the CCI's initial notice, forwarding the Director General's (DG) report and inviting replies and a hearing, adequately complied with the Act. It held that a separate show-cause notice dedicated solely to the penalty was not required under the statutory scheme.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a complaint alleging KFEF organized a boycott preventing distributors from dealing with a specific theater. The CCI, based on the DG's report, found KFEF in violation and imposed monetary penalties and behavioral directions on the federation and its office-bearers. The COMPAT (Competition Appellate Tribunal) upheld the violation finding but overturned penalties against the office-bearers, arguing the lack of a separate penalty notice.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court addressed whether a second, separate show-cause notice specifically proposing penalties is required before imposing sanctions under the Act. The Court emphasized that the Competition Act necessitates timely and effective adjudication, with a single hearing offering a full opportunity to address both findings and potential sanctions. The Court found that the initial notice sufficiently identified the contraventions, named the individuals involved, sought financial information, and scheduled a hearing, satisfying the requirements of natural justice. Furthermore, the Court highlighted that Section 48 of the Act deems individuals in charge responsible for contraventions, negating the need for separate notification of liability. The Supreme Court restored the CCI's original order in full, also noting the importance of the DG report stage and the need to address all factual and mitigation points at that hearing.</p>",
