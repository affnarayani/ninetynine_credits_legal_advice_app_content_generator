    "title": "Market Value on Execution Date Controls Stamp Duty, Rules High Court",
    "description": "<p>The Punjab and Haryana High Court, in a recent decision, has clarified that stamp duty on sale deeds should be assessed based on the market value prevailing on the date of execution and registration of the sale deed, not the date of the earlier agreement to sell. This ruling addresses a recurring issue under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, which governs stamp duty on property transactions.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's analysis centered on the interpretation of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, particularly Section 3, emphasizing that the duty is imposed on the instrument of conveyance itself. It relied heavily on the Supreme Court decision in *State of Rajasthan v. Khandaka Jain Jewellers*, which established that the relevant market value is that on the execution date of the conveyance deed. The Court distinguished precedents dealing with assignment deeds, finding them inapplicable to conveyances by sale.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court explicitly overruled a prior conflicting judgment, *Harvinder Pal Singla v. State of Haryana*, which had assessed stamp duty based on the market rate at the time of the agreement to sell. The Court reiterated that Section 3, in conjunction with Section 17, mandates that the sale instrument must be duly stamped at the time of execution, reflecting the then-prevailing market value. This decision provides clarity and ensures consistency in stamp duty application, aligning with Supreme Court precedent and serving as authoritative law within its jurisdiction.</p>",

    "title": "Jet Airways Ratio Re-affirmed: Liquidator Need Not Honour Post-liquidation PF Penalties",
    "description": "<p>The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Kochi Bench, ruled on July 9, 2025, that the liquidator of Raihan Healthcare Private Limited is not obligated to honor penalties assessed by the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) after the company entered liquidation. The case originated from a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) initiated against the hospital chain in March 2019, followed by a liquidation order in February 2020, appointing a liquidator.</p>\n\n<p>The EPFO initially filed a claim of \u20b91.73 crore for unpaid PF dues, which the liquidator admitted and subsequently paid \u20b91.90 crore, treating employer and employee contributions as exempt from the liquidation estate. A revised claim of \u20b94.72 crore was later submitted by the EPFO in 2023, including additional dues, damages, and interest based on post-liquidation assessments. The liquidator rejected this additional demand, prompting the EPFO to file an application under Section 60(5) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, seeking priority payment of the balance \u20b92.82 crore.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLT sided with the liquidator, holding that assessments conducted after the liquidation order are void due to the moratorium under Sections 14 and 33(5) of the Code. While basic contributions remain protected, penal damages and interest arising from post-liquidation orders are not entitled to priority or exemption. The Tribunal dismissed the EPFO's application, limiting their claim to the \u20b91.90 crore already disbursed, effectively ending the dispute.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) introduced the Advertisement Bye-Laws, 2024, effective July 17, 2025, under the Greater Bengaluru Governance Act, 2024. This comprehensive framework replaces the 2006 and 2018 bye-laws, aiming to standardize advertising practices, protect urban aesthetics, prevent unauthorized displays, and ensure transparent commercial exploitation of advertising spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Key regulatory features include structured licensing and registration for advertisers, with licenses valid for five years and subject to renewal. The allocation of advertising rights on notified roads and areas is conducted through public auction or tender via e-procurement, governed by the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act, 1999. Spatial restrictions and density norms are enforced, with minimum spacing requirements between hoardings and restrictions based on road width.</p>\n\n<p>The bye-laws also address ownership, taxation, and ground rent, stipulating that payment of advertisement fees to BBMP does not confer land rights and that advertisers must secure agreements with landowners. Environmental and safety compliance is mandated, requiring biodegradable materials and prohibiting plastic or PVC flexes, diesel generators, and disruptive illumination. Legacy advertisements are temporarily protected, while infrastructure advertisements are subject to separate tendering. Certain self-advertisements and advertisements by public utilities are exempt from fees under defined conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Enforcement mechanisms are codified, including penalties for non-compliance and removal of unauthorized displays. An Advertisement Regulatory Committee (ARC) oversees implementation, resolves disputes, and hears appeals. The bye-laws advance consumer protection by preventing misleading claims and ensuring public safety through structural stability requirements. Overall, the BBMP Advertisement Bye-Laws, 2024, represent a significant step toward structured commercialization of outdoor advertising, embedding transparency, environmental accountability, and public safety principles.</p>",

State of Bihar & Anr.*, overturned the bail granted to a shelter home superintendent accused of facilitating immoral trafficking and sexual exploitation of women inmates. The ruling, delivered on July 21, 2025, underscores the importance of considering the gravity of the offense, societal impact, and victim participation in bail decisions, particularly under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from systemic abuse at a government-run women's shelter home, where the superintendent allegedly administered intoxicating injections to inmates, enabling their sexual exploitation. The High Court granted bail to the accused, citing a lack of specific allegations, without impleading or hearing the victim, violating Section 15A(3) of the SC/ST Act. The Supreme Court emphasized that the High Court's order lacked adequate reasoning and breached procedural safeguards.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court held that the High Court erred in granting bail and highlighted the gravity of the allegations, the violation of the victim's right to be heard, the lack of reasoning in the bail order, and the threat to a fair trial posed by the accused's release. The Supreme Court cancelled the bail, ordering the accused to surrender and instructing the Trial Court and District Administration to protect victims and witnesses. This decision fortifies victim rights under the SC/ST Act, demands reasoned bail orders in cases of institutional abuse, and reinforces institutional accountability, advancing gender justice and social equity.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court addressed a case, *Thirumalaisamy v. State of Tamil Nadu*, involving a man convicted under the SC/ST Act for caste-based abuse of a Dalit woman. The case highlighted the persistent issue of caste discrimination in rural India, specifically concerning access to drinking water.</p>\n\n<p>Thirumalaisamy was convicted for using caste-based slurs against the victim during an altercation on her land and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment. Justice R.N. Manjula granted a suspension of the sentence but expanded the scope of the case in response to the victim's testimony regarding water inequality, where Dalit households were forced to wait until dominant castes finished using a public tap. The Court emphasized that access to clean water is a fundamental right integral to the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution, decrying the rule of the mighty over the rule of law.</p>\n\n<p>The Court issued specific directives to the District Collector of Tenkasi to ensure the prevention of caste-based discrimination in Thalaivankonttai village. These directives included the installation of adequate public water taps with equitable access for all communities, prohibiting any single community from claiming exclusive control over public water sources. A compliance report is due by July 31, 2025. The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in addressing social injustice beyond legal technicalities, recognizing that caste discrimination extends beyond overt acts of violence to include subtle denials of basic necessities.</p>",

    "title": "Intermediary Liability in the Digital Age: Judicial Enforcement and the Ramkumar Decision",
    "description": "<p>The expansion of India's digital ecosystem brings challenges regarding online harm, necessitating clarity on intermediary liability, specifically the extent to which digital platforms are accountable for hosted content. The Madras High Court's decision in *Ramkumar v. Union of India (2025)* offers insights into judicial expectations of intermediaries and the government in preventing access to child sexual exploitation content.</p>\n\n<p>Indian law, particularly Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, provides a \"safe harbor\" to intermediaries, protecting them from liability for third-party content if they exercise due diligence and act upon knowledge of unlawful content. The Supreme Court's decision in *Shreya Singhal v. Union of India* clarified that intermediaries are obligated to remove content only upon receiving a court order or notification from a government agency. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 further operationalize intermediary responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The *Ramkumar* case involved a film teaser allegedly depicting child pornography hosted on YouTube. The Madras High Court directed the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to remove the content, emphasizing the social responsibility of intermediaries and the urgency of child protection. The court prioritized the state's duty to act in cases of ongoing online harm, even without impleading YouTube LLC. This decision highlights a shift in judicial reasoning, prioritizing harm prevention over procedural technicalities in digital safety matters.</p>\n\n<p>This trend is mirrored in the Supreme Court's order in *X v. Union of India*, where the court addressed the circulation of non-consensual intimate images and directed the government to establish a centralized takedown mechanism. This ruling complements *Ramkumar* by underscoring that constitutional rights to privacy and protection from digital abuse should guide intermediary responsibilities. Overall, intermediary liability jurisprudence in India is evolving from a passive safe-harbor approach toward a responsibility-driven framework, with courts interpreting statutory protections in light of fundamental rights and public interest. The *Ramkumar* judgment emphasizes that intermediaries cannot remain neutral conduits in cases of serious violations like child exploitation, and government agencies cannot abdicate their duty to act.</p>",

Eastern Coalfields Ltd.*, reinforced the requirements for a valid arbitration agreement under Section 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The Court clarified that permissive language in a dispute resolution clause, such as \"may be sought through arbitration,\" does not constitute a binding agreement to arbitrate. This ruling aligns with precedents like *Jagdish Chander v. Ramesh Chander* and *Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. v. IVRCL AMR JV*, emphasizing the need for a clear consensus ad idem (mutual agreement) to arbitrate.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a commercial contract between BGM AND M-RPL-JMCT (JV) and Eastern Coalfields Ltd., where a dispute arose. The appellant sought arbitration based on Clause 13 of the contract, which stated that disputes \"may be sought through Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\" The Calcutta High Court rejected the application, deeming the clause insufficient as a valid arbitration agreement. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, stating that the language indicated a possibility rather than a mandatory commitment to arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized that while Section 11(6A) limits judicial review to the \"existence\" of an arbitration agreement, this necessitates a prima facie reading of the contract. A clause suggesting arbitration as a potential step does not fulfill the requirements of Section 7. The decision underscores the importance of using mandatory language, such as \"shall be referred to arbitration,\" to create a binding agreement. The ruling reaffirms that courts can scrutinize vague or tentative clauses early, preventing unnecessary arbitration referrals and enhancing the credibility of arbitration in India.</p>",

The Commission found both Flipkart and its seller, M/s Dhayal Trading, guilty of deficiency in service and unfair trade practice, ordering them to refund the purchase amount with interest and compensate for harassment and litigation expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose after Verma purchased a Nokia 6310 via Flipkart and received a malfunctioning device. Upon inspection at an authorized service center, it was discovered that the phone was an older model (Nokia 3310), had been activated in Pakistan in 2017, and was not new as advertised. Despite attempts to resolve the issue with Flipkart and the seller, Verma received no assistance, leading him to file a formal complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The seller and Nokia India did not appear before the Commission, and Flipkart's defense was struck off due to failure to file a written statement. Verma's claim was supported by documentary evidence, which the Commission accepted. The Commission concluded that selling a previously used or misidentified phone as new constituted a deficiency in service, fraud, and a deceptive trade practice, labeling it a \"dark pattern.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Commission directed Flipkart and the seller to refund \u20b92,999 with 9% interest, provide \u20b915,000 for mental harassment, and \u20b911,000 for litigation expenses. Non-compliance may result in execution proceedings and potential penalties under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, including imprisonment and fines.

This case resolved a decades-long property feud by scrutinizing the validity of a registered will and an oral family arrangement. The judgment emphasizes the heavy burden of proof required to dispute such instruments, particularly when factual evidence and consistent possession support their legitimacy.</p>\n\n<p>The case revolves around a property dispute over land originally owned by Metpalli Ramanna. His heir, Metpalli Rajanna, had two children, Muthaiah and Rajamma, from his first marriage, and was later married to Lasum Bai. Lasum Bai claimed ownership based on a registered will executed by Rajanna and an oral family arrangement. Muthaiah contested this, claiming the properties were joint ancestral properties and Rajanna died intestate. The trial court initially favored Lasum Bai, affirming the will and arrangement, but the High Court partially reversed this decision.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, restoring the trial court's original judgment. It emphasized the evidentiary value of the registered will, reinforced by Muthaiah's admission of his father's signatures and Lasum Bai's consistent possession of the property. The court underscored that a registered will carries a strong presumption of genuineness, placing a heavy burden on those challenging its authenticity and rejected Muthaiah's claim that he was entitled to inherit the property as an adopted son. The Supreme Court's verdict serves as a precedent, emphasizing that property rights are determined by sound appreciation of evidence and strict adherence to legal principles, particularly regarding properly executed testamentary documents.</p>",

Anjali Singh vs. State of U.P. and Another*, has directed the Family Court, Gautam Budh Nagar, to conclude a pending maintenance case within six months, emphasizing the urgency of financial relief for deserted wives under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. Justice Nalin Kumar Srivastava stressed the need for swift resolution in such cases, given the economic hardship faced by abandoned women, and underscored the responsibility of all actors in the justice system to avoid unnecessary delays.</p>\n\n<p>Maintenance under Indian law, primarily through Section 125 Cr.P.C., ensures financial support to spouses, minor children, or dependent parents unable to support themselves, irrespective of religion. To claim maintenance, a wife must demonstrate her husband's sufficient means and refusal to provide support; \"wife\" includes legally wedded and, in some cases, divorced, non-remarried women. Besides the Cr.P.C., maintenance claims can also be pursued under personal laws and special legislation like the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and the Domestic Violence Act.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Anjali Singh, who filed a maintenance case in the Family Court of Gautam Budh Nagar, contending that her husband's delaying tactics prolonged the proceedings. Her counsel argued that the repeated adjournments amounted to judicial harassment, as she had no independent source of income and depended on the litigation's outcome.</p>\n\n<p>The Court observed that Section 125 Cr.P.C. cases directly concern the dignity and well-being of vulnerable women and children and should be handled with compassion and urgency. It emphasized that delays in maintenance matters deny justice and amplify the emotional and financial distress of women. The Family Court was directed to decide the case within six months, granting no unnecessary adjournments, conditional on the applicant's full cooperation.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends in Indian maintenance law reflect increased judicial recognition of women's financial insecurity post-separation or divorce. Courts are increasingly setting time limits for resolution, proactively issuing interim maintenance orders, and using measures like salary attachment to ensure enforcement. Courts have also clarified that women can pursue maintenance under multiple legal frameworks simultaneously, provided there is no double recovery.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment matters because it recognizes that maintenance litigation is about restoring dignity and fairness, mandating a six-month deadline to aid similarly situated women nationwide. It broadens judicial responsibility to include all stakeholders, acknowledging that prolonged procedures can further victimize already suffering parties and promoting judicial accountability in family law litigation.</p>",

The ruling, delivered nearly two decades after the attacks that killed 189 and injured over 820, cited severe evidentiary and procedural flaws in the prosecution's case.</p>\n\n<p>The court found that the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had \"utterly failed\" to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Key issues included unreliable witness testimony and questionable investigative procedures. The High Court emphasized that guilt must be proven unequivocally, even in terror cases, and that coerced confessions and procedural lapses are unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>The acquittal raises significant questions about the ATS's investigative methods and the potential wrongful imprisonment of innocent individuals for nearly two decades.

The case arose after Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd. initiated proceedings under Section 14 of the Act to take possession of a mortgaged property following the death of the borrower, Abdul Aziz Sofi, after a Section 13(2) notice had already been served to him during his lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>The legal heirs challenged the bank's action, arguing that a fresh Section 13(2) notice should have been issued to them, asserting that the proceedings violated principles of natural justice. The bank countered that Section 14 is a summary remedy focused on the secured asset and not a personal action against the borrower, emphasizing that the initial Section 13(2) notice was validly served.</p>\n\n<p>The Court ruled in favor of the bank, dismissing the writ petition. It clarified that the death of the borrower does not extinguish the bank's right to proceed against the mortgaged property, as the liability transfers to the estate. The Court emphasized that Section 14's provisos only require affirmation of compliance with Section 13(2) as it stood during the borrower's lifetime and do not mandate a second round of notices to the successors. While dismissing the petition, the judges added that the bank would consider any One-Time Settlement scheme application by the petitioners.

The case involved a tenant who failed to adequately demonstrate a pre-existing, protected tenancy prior to a property's mortgage and subsequent action under SARFAESI.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose when PNB Housing Finance initiated SARFAESI proceedings against a borrower who had mortgaged the property. A tenant on the property asserted rights under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997, after the bank took possession. The High Court initially restored possession to the tenant, but the Supreme Court overturned this decision.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized that the 2016 amendment to SARFAESI provides a complete code, requiring tenants aggrieved by Section 13(4) measures to apply to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under Section 17(4A), and if necessary, appeal to the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal. The Court found that the tenant's evidence of continuous possession prior to the Section 13(2) notice was lacking. The court also cited *Bajarang Shyamsunder Agarwal*, clarifying protections for tenants under oral or unregistered agreements are limited to one year from the Section 13(2) notice.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling reinforces the statutory framework of SARFAESI, highlighting that High Court intervention under Article 227 is inappropriate when an effective statutory remedy exists.

The ruling, prompted by the case of a young advocate whose intimate moments were recorded and circulated without her consent, emphasizes the violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, specifically the Right to Privacy and Dignity.</p>\n\n<p>The court established a concrete framework for addressing NCII abuse. It mandates the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to act within 48 hours of receiving complaints, requiring swift removal of content. Digital intermediaries and law enforcement agencies are legally bound to act within 24 hours of notification. The framework requires victims to submit detailed affidavits, sensitized grievance officers across platforms, and a multilingual and accessible National Cybercrime Reporting Portal. Furthermore, it imposes obligations on search engines to employ hash-matching technology to prevent the reappearance of removed content and envisions a government-backed encrypted platform for registering and hashing NCII content.</p>\n\n<p>Justice N. Anand Venkatesh reinforced the message that digital abuse will face swift legal consequences, and victims will not be left to fight alone. The judgment marks a turning point in India's battle against online sexual exploitation and lays a roadmap for reclaiming digital dignity.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Himachal Pradesh High Court's decision in *Shirgul Filling Station v. Kamal Sharma* emphasizes the strict procedural requirements for cheque dishonor cases under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The court upheld the dismissal of a complaint filed by a sole proprietorship due to a failure to adequately prove the proprietorship and the legal standing of the person initiating the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>The Trial Court found that the complainant, Shirgul Filling Station, failed to provide conclusive proof that Shivani Gupta was the proprietor. The authority letter provided by Ankur Aggarwal was deemed invalid as it was issued after the legal notice was sent and the complaint filed, and was not a valid power of attorney. Furthermore, as the cheque was issued to Shirgul Filling Station, and Ankur Aggarwal failed to prove the proprietorship, he could not be considered the \"payee\" as required by Section 138.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed the Trial Court's decision, dismissing the criminal appeal and upholding the acquittal of Kamal Sharma. The judgment underscores the importance of adhering to procedural requirements, establishing clear locus standi with valid authorization, and ensuring authorization timeliness. This ruling serves as a reminder for litigants, especially those representing sole proprietorships, to ensure proper legal representation and meticulous observation of procedural formalities before initiating action under Section 138 of the NI Act. Failure to do so can result in dismissal, regardless of the underlying financial dispute.</p>",

The case involved Anil Verma, the petitioner, and Respondent No. 2, who had been in a 15-year relationship and cohabitating since 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The initial FIR, filed by the Respondent No. 2 due to misunderstandings, led to allegations of criminal offences. However, the parties subsequently reached an amicable settlement, with the complainant admitting the complaint was filed during a period of emotional distress and no longer wished to pursue the matter. Despite the State's opposition, arguing against setting a compromising precedent in cases involving alleged sexual exploitation, the Court recognized the complainant's autonomy and the personal nature of the dispute.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma emphasized that forcing a trial after reconciliation would be counterproductive. However, acknowledging the severity of initiating criminal proceedings based on misunderstandings, the Court imposed a cost of \u20b920,000 on the complainant, payable to the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee, to discourage the casual use of criminal law. Consequently, FIR No. 154/2025 and all related proceedings were quashed. The Court cautioned against using criminal law as a tool for emotional leverage in personal relationships, particularly given the severe legal and reputational consequences.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Thrissur has reaffirmed the significance of the Legal Metrology Act and consumer rights, ruling that charging even a single rupee over the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) on pre-packaged goods constitutes an unlawful and unfair trade practice. This decision reinforces the protection afforded by the Consumer Protection Act, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the MRP displayed on product packaging.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when a consumer, Lenish V.R., was charged Rs. 800 for a brandy bottle with an MRP of Rs. 740 at a Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) outlet. Despite KSBC acknowledging the overcharge, they failed to provide evidence justifying the additional amount. The Commission found that the consumer successfully demonstrated the violation, shifting the burden of proof to KSBC, which they could not fulfill.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission emphasized that as per the Legal Metrology Act, 2009, and the Packaged Commodities Rules, 2011, retailers are prohibited from selling pre-packaged commodities above the MRP, except in cases of valid tax revisions within a specific timeframe, which KSBC could not prove. The Commission also noted that, as a government-owned entity, KSBC has a responsibility to act as a model vendor, upholding consumer rights and statutory norms without exception.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission directed KSBC to refund the excess amount of Rs. 60, provide Rs. 5,000 in compensation for mental distress, and cover Rs. 10,000 in litigation costs, all with interest. Additionally, KSBC was instructed to immediately cease the practice of overcharging for pre-packaged commodities. This ruling serves as a clear warning to retailers, particularly government-owned establishments, regarding the sanctity of MRP and empowers consumers to actively protect their rights against unfair trade practices.</p>",

This initiative, aimed at enhancing housing affordability for economically weaker sections, aligns with the state's commitment to social welfare and housing rights.</p>\n\n<p>The exemption is enabled by the Kerala Stamp Act, 1959, and the Registration Act, 1908, which empower the State Government to remit or reduce stamp duty and registration fees in the public interest. The Life Mission scheme, Kerala\u2019s flagship housing program, aims to provide secure housing to landless and homeless families through financial assistance and infrastructure support.</p>\n\n<p>To avail of the exemption, beneficiaries must present a certificate from the District Collector or authorised Tehsildar confirming their status as a Life Mission beneficiary and the land's exclusive use for constructing a residential dwelling under the scheme. This exemption reduces the financial burden on beneficiaries, potentially saving them 8-10% of the transaction value, while requiring compliance with procedural requirements. Developers and NGOs involved in Life Mission projects should also factor this exemption into their processes, while the state foregoes revenue in favor of long-term social infrastructure development.</p>\n\n<p>This exemption represents a strategic regulatory intervention supporting inclusive housing by removing cost barriers for vulnerable households and reinforcing the State's focus on welfare-centric governance.

The Court held that spousal privilege under Section 122 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, does not bar such recordings when the dispute is between the spouses themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a husband seeking to introduce audio recordings as evidence of cruelty in divorce proceedings. The Supreme Court overturned a High Court decision that had disallowed the evidence based on privacy concerns, affirming the Family Court's initial decision to admit the recordings. The Court clarified that Section 122 contains an exception for suits between spouses, and the right to privacy under Article 21, while fundamental, is not absolute and must be balanced against the right to a fair trial.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court reaffirmed the existing test for admitting secretly recorded conversations, emphasizing that lack of consent alone does not render evidence inadmissible. Further, electronic records, including audio recordings, are admissible under Sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, provided the necessary certification is submitted. While not issuing binding procedural safeguards, the Court acknowledged the need for caution and suggested factors for Family Courts to consider when evaluating such evidence, including proportionality, intent, and evidentiary safeguards. The ruling balances the right to privacy with the imperatives of justice, allowing relevant evidence to be considered while acknowledging the potential for misuse.</p>",

The case involved a woman who allegedly committed suicide after her in-laws demanded money for legal expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The prosecution argued that the in-laws harassed the woman to procure \u20b950,000 from her father for bail in an unrelated land forgery case, leading her to take her own life. Initially, the FIR was registered under Sections 306 and 498A IPC, and later Section 304B was added, but the trial court acquitted the accused due to lack of evidence.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed the acquittal, clarifying that not every post-marital demand qualifies as \"dowry\" under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The court reasoned that the demand for bail money was a post-marital financial dispute, not a dowry demand made \"in connection with the marriage.\" However, the court also cautioned that while the demand didn't constitute dowry, the conduct could still amount to \"cruelty\" under Section 498A or abetment to suicide under Section 306, provided sufficient evidence exists. The court's decision was based on unproven medical causes of death, a lack of credible evidence of financial harassment, and accused having sufficient funds that contradicted the prosecution's narrative.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment underscores the importance of prosecutors carefully framing charges, gathering reliable evidence, and distinguishing between dowry-linked demands and other forms of oppressive conduct. While the decision is legally sound regarding Section 304B, it should not diminish the seriousness of non-dowry related cruelty, which remains actionable under other IPC provisions.</p>",

His family's claim for compensation was rejected by both the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal and the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court, in dismissing the family's appeal, affirmed the established tort law principle that individuals cannot benefit from their own wrongdoing. The Court reasoned that a borrower of a vehicle assumes the responsibilities and risks of ownership, including the duty to drive safely.

While she didn't claim ownership, she opposed the redevelopment without compensation and alternate accommodation. Ritesh, claiming ownership, sought to hand over the flat, viewing Leena as a gratuitous licensee.</p>\n\n<p>The court emphasized that redevelopment cannot replace formal eviction processes, reinforcing that Leena's eviction required a court decree. The court cited precedents highlighting that the person in actual possession at the time of redevelopment is entitled to transit rent and restoration of possession in the redeveloped property.

The prosecution is supported by digital evidence, including explicit photographs recovered from Ramdev's device, currently undergoing analysis at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL). The court expressed concern over the weaponization of digital tools for non-consensual sharing of private content, highlighting the trauma and virality associated with such acts.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court, in its June 2, 2025 ruling, cited the severity of the charges, the strength of digital evidence, and the risk of misuse as factors against granting bail. The court directed the trial court to conclude proceedings within one year. To expedite the process, the Deputy Director of the FSL was ordered to submit the final report within two months. The court also mandated strict witness management and empowered the trial court to impose costs for unwarranted delays. Police authorities were instructed to execute warrants promptly, and the Commissioner of Police, Prayagraj, must submit periodic affidavits on the execution status.</p>\n\n<p>The Allahabad High Court's order signifies a commitment to addressing cyber-crimes effectively and promptly, combining judicial scrutiny, digital-forensic prioritization, and institutional accountability.</p>",

    "title": "Enabling the 24-Hour Workforce: Haryana\u2019s 2025 Notification Opens Night Shifts to Women Workers",
    "description": "<p>The Haryana Labour Department issued a notification on July 4, 2025, permitting women to work night shifts (7:00 PM to 6:00 AM) in factories, marking a significant step toward gender inclusivity. This policy aligns with the growing trend of balancing equal opportunity with necessary workplace protections.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, Section 66(1)(b) of the Factories Act, 1948, restricted women from working night shifts, but this provision has been challenged as discriminatory. The Haryana notification, issued under No. 11/6/2022-4Lab, supersedes previous notifications and sets forth comprehensive conditions for factories employing women at night.</p>\n\n<p>Key requirements include voluntary written consent from women workers, full compliance with the POSH Act, enhanced workplace safety measures including CCTV surveillance, mandatory transportation, readily available medical assistance, and adherence to all applicable labor laws, including the Factories Act, 1948 and the Equal Remuneration Act. Employers must also report any untoward incident immediately, implement a self-certification mechanism, and be aware that the government may impose additional conditions. The exemption granted is valid for one year.</p>\n\n<p>This notification represents a progressive move, removing outdated restrictions while enhancing employer accountability. It positions Haryana alongside states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, which have similar exemptions, and supports India's expanding manufacturing base by promoting economic participation and gender justice in industrial employment.</p>",
