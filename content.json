    "title": "Supreme Court Addresses Conflict Between Forest Rights Act and Forest Conservation Act on Tribal Housing",
    "description": "<p>In *Sugra Adiwasi & Ors. v. Pathranand & Ors.*, the Supreme Court of India examined the intersection of the Forest Rights Act (FRA) and the Forest Conservation Act (FCA) concerning the construction of permanent housing for forest dwellers. The court acknowledged the conflict between recognizing the rights of tribal communities to adequate housing and the need to preserve forest ecology.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a dispute over whether forest dwellers could construct permanent homes on forest land without violating the FCA. Petitioners argued the FRA grants habitation rights, including durable housing, while the Union of India emphasized the FCA's role in forest preservation. The core legal issue was whether FRA-recognized construction could proceed despite FCA regulations.</p>\n\n<p>The Court analyzed both Acts, noting the FRA's limited \"notwithstanding\" clause doesn't explicitly authorize housing construction without FCA oversight. It reaffirmed that the FCA regulates, rather than prohibits, non-forest activities, emphasizing forest protection as a constitutional obligation. The court stressed the need for a \"convergent interpretation\" where both statutes coexist, protecting human and environmental interests.</p>\n\n<p>Acknowledging the State's duty to ensure minimum living conditions, the Supreme Court directed the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the Ministry of Tribal Affairs to formulate a regulatory mechanism enabling dwelling construction for forest dwellers, ensuring FCA compliance. This directive emphasizes inter-departmental coordination and a balanced approach, reflecting a commitment to both social justice and environmental stewardship.</p>",

    "title": "Delhi High Court on Mental Cruelty: False Allegations, Vexatious Litigation and the Boundaries of Matrimonial Conduct",
    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court in *X v. Y* upheld a divorce decree based on mental cruelty, reaffirming the definition of cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. The court dismissed the wife's appeal, emphasizing that a consistent pattern of false allegations, unsubstantiated criminal complaints, and vindictive litigation constitutes sufficient grounds for divorce due to the mental anguish inflicted on the other spouse.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a marriage marred by extensive litigation, with the wife initiating numerous complaints, including those under Section 498A of the IPC and the Domestic Violence Act, most of which were later found to be baseless. The Family Court initially granted the divorce, citing the severe mental agony and social humiliation suffered by the husband due to the wife's actions.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court's decision highlighted that mental cruelty encompasses not only physical harm but also emotional distress caused by repeated baseless accusations, character assassination, and the misuse of legal provisions. While \"irretrievable breakdown of marriage\" is not a statutory ground for divorce, the court acknowledged that prolonged separation and loss of trust, in conjunction with demonstrated cruelty, support the dissolution of marriage. The judgment serves as a significant precedent, urging courts to recognize the psychological impact of relentless litigation and ensuring that legal remedies are not weaponized for personal vendettas within matrimonial disputes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court, in the case of *Indian Overseas Bank v. M/s Radhey Infra Solutions (Pvt.) Ltd.*, addressed the issue of delays in debt recovery proceedings under the SARFAESI Act. The court emphasized that the statutory timelines mandated by Section 17(5) of the Act must be strictly adhered to by Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs).</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a borrower's application under Section 17(1) of the SARFAESI Act, which remained pending before the DRT, Dehradun, for an extended period without any extension orders or recorded reasons. The Supreme Court underscored that Section 17(5) requires DRTs to dispose of such applications within 60 days, extendable by a maximum of four months with written justification for each extension. The Court criticized the High Court's previous order for not enforcing the timeline.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court directed the DRT, Dehradun, to immediately comply with Section 17(5) of the SARFAESI Act and dispose of the pending application expeditiously. This ruling serves as a reminder to all DRTs that the statutory timelines are not merely suggestive but are crucial for ensuring timely debt recovery and adjudication of borrower grievances, thereby reinforcing the importance of time in commercial matters.</p>",

    "title": "No Shortcut on Stamp Duty \u2013 Supreme Court Says Security Bonds by Debtors Are Mortgage Deeds",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in *M/s Godwin Construction Pvt. Ltd. v. Commissioner, Meerut Division & Anr.*, clarified the classification of instruments for stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. The Court ruled that when a party executes a deed to secure its own obligations, it is classified as a mortgage deed under Article 40, regardless of being titled a \"Security Bond cum Mortgage Deed.\" This is based on the principle that the substance of the transaction prevails over its form.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a dispute where M/s Godwin Construction Pvt. Ltd. executed a \"Security Bond cum Mortgage Deed\" to the Meerut Development Authority (MDA) to secure development obligations, paying stamp duty under the \"Security Bond\" category. Authorities later deemed it a mortgage deed, demanding additional stamp duty. The Supreme Court, upholding lower court decisions, emphasized that Article 57 (Security Bond) applies only when a third-party surety guarantees another's obligations, as per Section 126 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Because the developer mortgaged its own property and no surety was involved, Article 40 (Mortgage Deed) was deemed applicable.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment reinforces that the true legal character of a document is determined by its operative terms and recitals, not merely its title. Where a party mortgages their own property to secure obligations, it constitutes a mortgage deed. This ruling offers clarity for developers, lenders, and authorities, minimizing ambiguity and ensuring consistent stamp duty assessment in real estate and financing transactions. It also underscores the importance of precise legal language in security documents to avoid future disputes.</p>",

    "title": "Understanding the Greenhouse Gases Emission Intensity Target Rules, 2025: A Comprehensive Overview",
    "description": "<p>The Greenhouse Gases Emission Intensity Target Rules, 2025, introduced by the Indian government, aim to curb greenhouse gas emissions across key industrial sectors. Aligned with frameworks like the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, these rules enforce emission reduction targets by focusing on emission intensity, promoting efficiency improvements without hindering economic growth. The rules provide comprehensive definitions, including terms like \"banked\" carbon credits, \"compliance year,\" and specific measurements for \"greenhouse gases emission intensity targets.\" Definitions also reference related legislation like the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023, ensuring consistency across environmental policies.</p>\n\n<p>The rules establish specific emission intensity targets for sectors like Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, and Pulp and Paper. These targets, outlined in the Schedule, provide a trajectory for emission intensity reductions. For instance, entities in the Aluminium sector face baseline GHG emission intensities with specific reduction targets for subsequent years. This structured approach fosters accountability and progress tracking.</p>\n\n<p>Obligated entities must achieve the emission intensity targets specified in the Schedule. Shortfalls require entities to surrender banked carbon credit certificates or purchase new ones. Registration on the designated portal under the Indian Carbon Market Framework and submission of required documentation are also mandatory. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency manages the issuance of carbon credit certificates, providing an incentive for emission reductions. The number of certificates issued is based on the difference between achieved and target emission intensities, multiplied by production units. Entities can bank these certificates for future use.</p>\n\n<p>Environmental compensation is imposed on obligated entities failing to meet the requirements. The Central Pollution Control Board sets the compensation at twice the average price of carbon credit certificates traded during the relevant compliance year's trading cycle. Payment must be made within 90 days, with additional penalties under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 for non-compliance. Collected funds are used for initiatives aligned with the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme, 2023.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Greenhouse Gases Emission Intensity Target Rules, 2025, offer a framework for reducing emissions in India, balancing regulatory stringency with practical implementation. Effective enforcement and stakeholder collaboration are critical to achieving national and international environmental goals.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (East Delhi) has ruled in favor of a consumer, directing Amazon Retail India Pvt. Ltd. and Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. to issue a refund for delivering an incorrect and obsolete laptop model. This decision underscores the accountability of e-commerce platforms in ensuring accurate product delivery and transparent refund processes, emphasizing that internal \"Use Policy\" disclaimers cannot supersede consumer protections under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when Mr. Harjas Singh Sodhi ordered an HP Pavilion laptop from Amazon (sold by Appario Retail) but received an old IBM ThinkPad instead. Despite promptly reporting the issue, initiating a return, and complying with Amazon's procedures, his refund request was rejected under the claim that the returned item was \"lost in transit\" and that his account had exceeded refund limits per Amazon's internal policy.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission found Amazon Retail India Pvt. Ltd. and Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. jointly and severally liable for deficiency in service. It directed them to refund \u20b961,990 for the laptop, pay \u20b910,000 in compensation for mental distress and inconvenience, and reimburse \u20b95,000 for litigation costs, with an 11% annual interest on the total amount if compliance isn't met within 30 days. This ruling reinforces the responsibility of e-commerce platforms in managing logistics and refund processes and calls for transparent and verifiable systems to uphold consumer trust.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India overturned a Calcutta High Court order, clarifying that industrial and commercial entities cannot seek restoration of acquired land under judicial directions intended for dispossessed farmers. The ruling emphasizes that the relief granted in *Kedar Nath Yadav v. State of West Bengal*, which restored land to cultivators, was a socially remedial measure to protect vulnerable agricultural communities displaced by state acquisition, and should not be extended to industrial undertakings.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from the Singur Project, where the West Bengal government acquired land for Tata Motors' Nano plant, including land owned by M/s Santi Ceramics Pvt. Ltd. Santi Ceramics accepted compensation for its land but later sought restoration based on the *Kedar Nath Yadav* ruling, which quashed the acquisition. While the High Court allowed the petition, the Supreme Court reversed this decision, stating that the remedy in *Kedar Nath Yadav* was specifically for disadvantaged farmers and not for commercial entities.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Santi Ceramics but granted limited relief regarding its factory structures and machinery. This judgment reinforces that judicial directions aimed at protecting vulnerable sections cannot be expanded to include commercial entities that benefited from the acquisition process. It underscores the distinction between public welfare remedies and private commercial claims, while upholding principles of waiver, estoppel, and finality in acquisition proceedings.</p>",

The Court noted that the Special General Body Meeting, where the redevelopment proposal was approved, was conducted with an Authorized Officer present and with the consent of the majority of members.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Court dismissed the writ petition, upholding the Society's decision to proceed with the redevelopment. The Court emphasized that the Society substantially complied with the procedural requirements, and the redevelopment decision was made in a properly convened meeting with majority approval. The Court also stated that the petitioner's allegations involved disputed questions of fact and, therefore, were not suitable for determination under writ jurisdiction.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Effective April 1, 2026, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) will implement the \"Insurance Fraud Monitoring Framework Guidelines, 2025,\" a new set of legally binding instructions designed to combat fraud across the Indian insurance sector. These guidelines aim to establish a zero-tolerance ecosystem, shifting the perception of fraud from an operational risk to a strategic threat requiring proactive involvement from all stakeholders, including insurers, intermediaries, and related entities.</p>\n\n<p>The new framework repeals the 2013 guidelines and applies to all insurers and distribution channels, unless specifically exempted. It tightens definitions of \"insurance fraud\" and introduces concepts like \"red-flag indicators\" and \"cyber or new-age fraud.\" A standardized five-category taxonomy for classifying fraud (internal, distribution-channel, policy-holder/claims, external, and affinity/complex) is established for consistent reporting to the board and IRDAI, enabling industry-wide heat map creation.</p>\n\n<p>At the core of the regime is the Fraud Risk Management Framework, requiring a board-approved, entity-specific set of controls reviewed annually. This framework must include an anti-fraud policy, detailed procedures, defined turnaround times, designated responsible officers, and whistleblower protections. A dedicated Fraud Monitoring Unit is mandated, along with missed-detection reviews. The Fraud Monitoring Committee, composed of key management personnel, will oversee the framework's day-to-day operation, recommending controls, responding to suspicions, maintaining evidence, sharing intelligence, and conducting annual risk assessments.</p>\n\n<p>The guidelines emphasize scientific risk identification, requiring insurers to build libraries of red-flag indicators and incorporate them into workflows. Category-specific controls must address each fraud bucket. A central database of convicted or attempted fraudsters is to be maintained. Cyber fraud receives special attention, necessitating robust cybersecurity architectures and multi-factor customer authentication. The Insurance Information Bureau is designated as the industry's fraud intelligence hub, collecting data from insurers and providing real-time alerts.</p>\n\n<p>Re-insurers, both Indian and foreign, must adhere to the stricter of their home jurisdiction's anti-fraud standards or the IRDAI guidelines. Distribution channels face obligations based on their size, ranging from implementing their own fraud-risk frameworks to complying with insurers' anti-fraud codes. Training and awareness programs are mandatory for employees, management, partners, and the public. Reporting timelines are compressed, requiring prompt notification of law-enforcement and annual statutory returns, with immediate escalation to IRDAI in cases involving registered distribution channels.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) ruled against Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC), affirming that a banker's lien cannot override the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) asset-pooling philosophy. The case stemmed from a \u20b927.60 crore fixed deposit of Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited (RITL) held with ICBC. ICBC sought to retain the FD to offset debts of another Reliance affiliate, Reliance Infrastructure Limited (RITL), after RITL defaulted on loan obligations to the bank.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the existence of a \u201cletter of lien and set-off,\u201d the NCLAT sided with the Resolution Professional (RP), emphasizing that the corporate debtor (RITL) owed nothing directly to ICBC. Therefore, the bank could not invoke a general lien under Section 171 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The NCLAT highlighted that Section 171 applies only when the customer placing the deposit owes a debt.</p>\n\n<p>The tribunal emphasized that once the CIRP commenced, the asset fell under the RP's control per Section 17(1)(d) of the IBC. Additionally, ICBC's failure to file a claim during the CIRP and the approved resolution plan earmarking the FD for financial creditors further weakened the bank's position. The NCLAT upheld the NCLT's order, directing ICBC to release the FD with accrued interest to the RP, reinforcing the principle that a banker's lien is contingent on a direct debt from the depositor and that self-help remedies are superseded by the IBC's collective resolution process.</p>",

The case was sent back to the JJB with specific instructions for conducting a preliminary assessment as required by Section 15 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court highlighted the ambiguity within Section 15(1) of the JJ Act, 2015, noting its lack of specific guidelines for conducting the preliminary assessment. Drawing upon the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in *Barun Chandra Thakur vs Master Bholu* (2022), the High Court stressed that the assessment demands a careful and individualized approach, examining the child\u2019s physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. The court reinforced the principle that maturity is a developmental process, and juveniles are particularly vulnerable to impulsivity and external factors.</p>\n\n<p>While the statute states that the Board \"may\" seek assistance from psychologists or psychosocial workers, the High Court mandated that such assistance should be compulsory unless the Board includes a qualified child psychologist or psychiatrist. If the Board opts not to utilize expert assistance, it must document the specific reasons for doing so.</p>\n\n<p>The Court identified several inadequacies in the initial assessment, including a lack of proper methodology, superficial questioning, and the absence of a comprehensive evaluation of the juvenile's psychological and social background. Because of these shortcomings, the High Court ruled that the original orders were unlawful and needed to be revoked.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court issued a set of binding guidelines for Juvenile Justice Boards and Children's Courts to follow when conducting preliminary assessments of juveniles accused of serious crimes, pending the development of more detailed rules by the legislature or higher authorities.</p>",

The suit sought a permanent injunction, restraining the defendants from infringing the trademark, passing off goods and services, and using the domain name or similar artwork, along with a request to suspend and transfer the domain name.</p>\n\n<p>The court considered evidence including trademark registrations, side-by-side comparisons of the marks, and WhatsApp transcripts demonstrating the defendants' active use of the \"JIO\" name for taxi operations. The court also noted that the defendants altered their business name and website content after receiving a legal notice, which the court interpreted as an implicit acknowledgement of the infringement.

    "description": "<p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced a structured reporting framework in 2019 to oversee the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies in India's securities markets. This framework aims to balance technological innovation with regulatory oversight, ensuring transparency, auditability, and accountability in algorithmic trading and intermediary functions. The initiative is part of SEBI's broader Enhanced Supervision Programme, designed to strengthen technology governance and systemic risk management.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, SEBI directed all recognised exchanges to establish a uniform supervisory framework for tracking AI/ML systems used by intermediaries. The Metropolitan Stock Exchange (MSE) implemented this through half-yearly reporting obligations, requiring members to disclose details of AI/ML systems used for trading, risk management, or investor servicing, even mandating NIL declarations for those not using such systems. In 2023, the reporting framework was broadened to include predictive, analytical, and pattern-recognition algorithms used across various functions, with greater emphasis on auditability and documentation.</p>\n\n<p>In 2025, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) introduced a cross-exchange reporting mechanism, allowing trading members registered with NSE to make a single AI/ML disclosure filing shared with other exchanges. This harmonised model, adopted by MSE, reduces duplication and simplifies compliance for multi-exchange firms. The framework mandates that all algorithmic trading members report the use of AI/ML systems, whether developed in-house or procured from third-party vendors, and maintain comprehensive documentation for supervisory reviews. SEBI's approach emphasizes technological neutrality with regulatory accountability, ensuring that AI/ML tools operate within parameters that protect market integrity and investor trust.</p>",

The Court clarified that this regulation can only be exercised to prevent profiteering, commercialization, or capitation fees, ensuring that collected fees are exclusively used for educational purposes, as mandated by the Delhi School Education Act, 1973 (DSEA) and the Delhi School Education Rules, 1973 (DSER).</p>\n\n<p>The judgment, delivered by a Division Bench, reaffirms the autonomy of private unaided institutions while protecting against exploitation. The case originated from writ petitions by Bluebells School International and Lilawati Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School, challenging DoE orders restricting fee increases. A Single Judge previously quashed the orders, permitting DoE to act only against profiteering.</p>\n\n<p>The central legal issue was whether the DoE could control the fee structure or if its power was confined to preventing profiteering. The Court analyzed Sections 17, 18, and 24 of the DSEA and Rules 172-177 of the DSER, noting the statutory framework promotes transparency but doesn't empower DoE to dictate fee structures. The Court referenced precedents like T.M.A. Pai Foundation and Modern School v. Union of India, emphasizing the state's duty to prevent exploitation but not to micromanage finances.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court upheld that the DoE may regulate fees only to prevent profiteering, ensuring funds are used for educational purposes. While the court dismissed the appeals and affirmed the Single Judge's judgment, it granted the DoE the liberty to proceed against the schools if statutory violations are found, provided due procedure and natural justice are followed.

The court examined whether permanent expulsion was an appropriate disciplinary action, balancing the need for academic integrity with constitutional principles of fairness and the right to life and dignity.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved five MBBS students accused of impersonation during examinations. The University's Unfair Means Committee recommended their expulsion, which the Vice Chancellor approved. The students argued that permanent expulsion was excessively harsh and violated their fundamental rights, especially considering the discretionary powers available to the Vice Chancellor under the University Statute. They referenced precedents emphasizing proportionality in punishment and advocating for a reformative approach to discipline.</p>\n\n<p>The University defended its decision, citing the severity of impersonation and the need to maintain academic credibility. They argued that the \"Rules for Unfair Means\" were properly implemented and that students were bound by the University's disciplinary jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court held that while it respects academic autonomy, it can intervene in cases of arbitrary or disproportionate punishment. Justice Sinha found that the Vice Chancellor had mechanically accepted the Committee's recommendation without independent reasoning. The Court emphasized that permanent expulsion was excessively harsh for first-time offenders, preventing any chance of reform. Consequently, the court modified the punishments, emphasizing that this leniency should not be mistaken for condoning the misconduct.

The informant sought an investigation into a purported \"Maggi Sauce scam\" and requested interim relief.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI found no prima facie contravention of the Competition Act, clarifying that the allegations centered on food safety, hygiene, and product labelling, issues under the jurisdiction of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The Commission emphasized that the alleged use of dirty water and mislabelling did not constitute anti-competitive practices or demonstrate that Nestle exploited its market position to restrict competitors or harm consumers.</p>\n\n<p>The decision reinforces that unethical business practices do not automatically equate to abuse of dominance unless they directly impact market competition. The CCI underscored its role in ensuring market fairness and efficiency, distinct from addressing general consumer grievances or regulatory non-compliance related to food safety. The order clarifies the boundary between competition law and sectoral regulation, directing concerns regarding public health, product contamination, or deceptive labelling to appropriate authorities like the FSSAI.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Hind Samachar Ltd. (Delhi Unit) v. National Insurance Company Ltd. & Ors., has clarified that a vehicle owner cannot be held liable solely based on the subsequent discovery of a fake driver's license. The court emphasized that an insurer must demonstrate a deliberate violation of policy conditions or substantial evidence of collusion to deny indemnification. This decision bolsters the legal framework surrounding \"pay and recover\" cases under the Motor Vehicles Act, reinforcing the principle that an insured owner's good faith is presumed unless proven otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a fatal road accident involving a truck owned by Hind Samachar Ltd. and a Matador van. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) initially ruled both vehicles negligent and directed the truck's insurer to indemnify the owner, despite allegations of a fake driver's license. The Delhi High Court reversed this, finding collusion and granting the insurer the right to recover compensation from the owner.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, emphasizing that the insurer failed to provide sufficient evidence of collusion or negligence on the owner's part. The court reiterated that the insurer bears the burden of proving the insured knowingly entrusted the vehicle to an unqualified driver or willfully breached policy conditions. The court found that the owner acted with reasonable diligence by verifying the driver's license and producing renewal records from the licensing authority.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court concluded that without proof of willful breach or collusion, the High Court's direction allowing the insurer to recover compensation from the vehicle owner was legally unsound. The ruling reaffirms that vehicle owners are not expected to conduct exhaustive license verification unless there are specific reasons for suspicion. The decision reinforces the welfare intent of the Motor Vehicles Act to ensure victim compensation without unjustly burdening owners acting in good faith.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in K.S. Shivappa v. Smt. K. Neelamma, clarified that a minor's repudiation of an unauthorized property sale by their guardian, without prior court permission under Section 8(2) of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, does not necessarily require a formal lawsuit. Such a sale is voidable, not void, and repudiation can be effectively demonstrated through clear and unequivocal conduct, such as the subsequent sale of the property after attaining majority.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a dispute over land originally purchased in the names of three minor sons and later sold by their father/guardian without the required court permission. After attaining majority, the sons sold the land to a different party, thus repudiating the original sale. The Supreme Court examined the legal implications of Section 8(2) and 8(3) of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 and ultimately ruled in favor of the sons' right to repudiate the sale through their conduct, emphasizing that the Act does not explicitly mandate a civil suit for setting aside such transactions.</p>\n\n<p>The Court underscored that once a voidable transaction is avoided by the minor, it becomes void ab initio. The Supreme Court's decision highlights the importance of protecting minors' property rights while promoting fairness and clarity in property law and strengthens both substantive justice and transactional integrity.</p>",

The court emphasized the importance of protecting the child's rights, privacy, and dignity, reinforcing constitutional safeguards under Articles 20(3) and 21. The ruling highlights that DNA testing should not be used intrusively in litigation without strong justification.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a maintenance petition filed by the wife after a divorce. The husband sought a DNA test, claiming his ex-wife had previously admitted the child was not his. The court ruled against this, citing the lack of a prima facie case, an inordinate delay since the divorce, and the potential harm to the child. The court referenced Section 116 of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, which presumes a child's legitimacy unless non-access is proven, a legal safeguard.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Shamim Ahmed underscored that forensic methods should not infringe upon fundamental rights or be misused. The court stated that ordering a DNA test in this situation would violate the child's right to privacy and potentially cause lifelong stigma. The court concluded that the husband\u2019s plea lacked merit and appeared to be an attempt to humiliate the wife and prolong the litigation.

The ruling underscores the pro-arbitration stance of Indian courts and provides clarity on interpreting arbitration clauses in light of the 2015 Amendment.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute stemmed from a contract between Offshore Infrastructures and Bharat Petroleum, where Offshore Infrastructures sought arbitration due to outstanding dues. The original arbitration clause designated the Managing Director of Bharat Petroleum as the sole arbitrator, a provision rendered inconsistent with the 2015 Amendment to the Arbitration Act, which aims to ensure arbitrator neutrality. The High Court dismissed Offshore Infrastructures' application for arbitrator appointment as time-barred, calculating the limitation period from the date of the No Claim Certificate.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, holding that the ineligibility of a named arbitrator does not invalidate the entire arbitration clause. It affirmed that the parties' intent to arbitrate remains valid and that courts retain the power under Section 11(6) to appoint an independent arbitrator. The Court further clarified the limitation period, considering the Supreme Court\u2019s COVID-19-related extension orders. It ruled that the application was within the prescribed limitation period when accounting for the exclusion of time between March 15, 2020, and February 28, 2022.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court directed the matter to the Delhi International Arbitration Centre (DIAC) for the appointment of an independent arbitrator.

Union of India, upheld the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change\u2019s (MoEF&CC) 2025 notification clarifying the application of general conditions to building and township projects under the 2006 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification. The Court found that the 2006 notification never applied these conditions to projects under Entries 8(a) and 8(b), thus the 2025 clarification did not dilute environmental safeguards.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Court struck down Note 1 in Entry 8(a), which exempted industrial sheds, schools, colleges, and hostels from EIA requirements. The Court deemed this exemption arbitrary and contrary to the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, arguing that large-scale construction, regardless of its purpose, has an environmental impact and cannot be shielded from assessment.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling reinforces the doctrine of sustainable development and provides interpretive clarity on the EIA regime. By upholding the 2025 notification (excluding Note 1), the Court balances effective environmental regulation with legitimate development, recognizing the role of State Environment Impact Assessment Authorities (SEIAAs) while preventing arbitrary exemptions. The judgment is likely to serve as a key precedent for future disputes regarding delegated environmental legislation and the limits of administrative clarification.</p>",

The CCI's market study recognizes AI's potential to promote efficiency and innovation, but also its capacity to distort markets through opaque and exclusionary practices. The report serves as a foundation for aligning competition law, consumer protection, and data regulation in India's AI economy.</p>\n\n<p>The study identifies AI's growing influence in sectors like banking, e-commerce, and healthcare, leading to cost efficiency and predictive analytics. However, it also notes an imbalance, with a few large players dominating critical layers of the AI infrastructure, creating entry barriers for smaller competitors. This market concentration allows dominant firms to engage in \"ecosystem lock-in,\" challenging the goal of fair competition.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI recognizes that AI's self-learning abilities test traditional enforcement tools. AI can enable tacit collusion without explicit agreements, while dynamic pricing risks consumer harm through personalized pricing. Data-driven network effects also favor incumbents, raising barriers for smaller businesses. The study cautions that mergers and acquisitions in the AI industry require closer scrutiny by competition authorities.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI proposes a shift towards proactive ecosystem monitoring, encouraging AI deploying enterprises to conduct competition compliance audits. The report recommends disclosing key aspects of AI functioning to foster trust and contestability. It also plans to establish a Digital Markets and AI Think Tank and calls for inter-regulatory coordination to harmonize AI, data privacy, and consumer protection regulations. The CCI sets ethical boundaries for algorithmic conduct and emphasizes that AI must serve as a tool for competition, not a substitute. The CCI's report mirrors global trends and adapts them to the Indian digital ecosystem, balancing innovation incentives with legal oversight.

The informant contested BSNL's disqualification of its bid for a tender concerning Splice Closures for Optical Fiber Cables, arguing that the tender conditions were discriminatory and favored certain bidders.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI, upon examination, defined the relevant market as Telecommunication Services in India. It found that BSNL's market share (approximately 2.09%) was significantly smaller than those of its major competitors, such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. The commission concluded that BSNL did not hold a dominant position. It also noted that the disqualification was based on past performance criteria, not turnover.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the CCI determined that no prima facie case of contravention of Section 4 of the Act was established against BSNL. The Commission closed the matter under Section 26(2) of the Competition Act, 2002, dismissing the application for interim relief and concluding that BSNL's actions did not constitute abuse of dominance or restrictive trade practices.</p>",

An arbitral award must adhere to the contract's parameters; deviations, either by disregarding terms or granting inconsistent relief, undermine the agreement's sanctity and the tribunal's jurisdiction, making the award vulnerable under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>\n\n<p>The Indian arbitration framework, particularly Section 28(3) of the Act, emphasizes contractual sanctity, mandating tribunals to decide per the contract's terms. Arbitrators interpret, but do not rewrite, contracts based on equity or fairness. The Supreme Court of India has consistently reinforced that tribunals are creations of the contract, unable to exceed their mandate. Awards violating express terms are deemed patently illegal and against public policy.</p>\n\n<p>Evidentiary discipline and procedural adherence are crucial, especially concerning contractual preconditions like notices or written approvals. Tribunals cannot waive these stipulations unless permitted by the contract. The Supreme Court has reinforced that commercial fairness cannot override contractual discipline, as seen in SEPCO Electric Power Construction Corporation vs. GMR Kamalanga Energy Ltd., where the court set aside a tribunal's decision for wrongly invoking equitable estoppel to overlook mandatory contractual notices.</p>\n\n<p>Judicial review under Sections 34 and 37 serves as a safeguard against arbitral excess, intervening when awards exhibit patent illegality or violate public policy, ensuring arbitration remains true to party consent. Contracting parties must draft precisely and adhere to performance requirements. Courts assess whether awards respect the agreement's boundaries, exercising restraint when faithful interpretations exist and correcting departures.</p>\n\n<p>Arbitration's strength lies in predictability and respect for autonomy. Tribunals upholding the agreement's integrity reinforce commercial certainty. Conversely, exceeding mandates undermines the process. Awards must be rooted in the contract, ensuring arbitration remains an extension of party autonomy governed by the rule of contract.</p>",

The case arose after Google terminated Liberty Infospace's account, citing violations of Developer Program Policies and association with previously banned accounts. Liberty Infospace alleged abuse of dominant position by Google, claiming unilateral termination and lack of due process.</p>\n\n<p>Liberty Infospace sought investigation, penalties, and structural changes to ensure transparent enforcement of Play Store policies. Google argued that the issue was an individual grievance related to policy enforcement, relying on prior CCI decisions that upheld the legitimacy of Play Store enforcement mechanisms. Google asserted that the enforcement was proportionate and consistent with global standards.</p>\n\n<p>The CCI framed issues to determine if Google abused its dominant position by terminating the account, if the termination had an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC), and if interim relief should be granted. Ultimately, the CCI's order reinforces that competition law intervenes in digital platforms only when market-wide harm, exclusionary conduct, or unfair leveraging is evident.

Suresh Chand, the Supreme Court addressed whether an agreement to sell, a general power of attorney (GPA), or a registered will can independently transfer title to immovable property. The Court reinforced that these instruments, particularly a will under suspicious circumstances, cannot establish title without strict legal proof. This decision solidifies existing jurisprudence against informal property transfers.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose between brothers over inherited property. One brother claimed ownership based on an agreement to sell, GPA, affidavit, and registered will, while the other contested the documents' validity. The Supreme Court, referencing prior rulings like Suraj Lamp, reiterated that under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, an agreement to sell only grants a right to enforce specific performance, not ownership. A GPA is an agency instrument, not a conveyance, and requires explicit transfer language to pass title.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized that a registered will is not self-proving and requires rigorous proof under the Indian Succession Act and Evidence Act. This includes attestation by two witnesses, with at least one testifying. In this case, the will, favoring one son without explanation and lacking examined attesting witnesses, was deemed unproven. The Supreme Court affirmed that while this ruling introduces no new doctrine, it underscores the need for proper conveyancing and heightened legal awareness in familial property matters where informal documents are often used to effect property transfers.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The High Court of Kerala addressed the devolution of a Hindu male's self-acquired property under the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law before the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The ruling affirms the principle that male issue exclusively succeeded to the separate property of the father if the death occurred prior to the Act's commencement, prioritizing the male line in succession and excluding daughters when a son was present.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a dismissed partition suit where the appellants, legal heirs of Rama Pai's daughter, contested a 1965 sale of Rama Pai's self-acquired property by his son, Hari Pai. The appellants argued that the property should have devolved jointly upon Hari Pai and Rama Pai's daughter. The respondents countered that Rama Pai died before 1956, making his son the sole heir. The court upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that Rama Pai had died before 17.06.1956 based on the unchallenged oral testimony of a witness stating the death occurred in 1950.</p>\n\n<p>The court rejected the appellant's reliance on the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, 1929, noting that it only introduced a limited set of female heirs and did not confer on a daughter the same status as a son when a son was present. Under the Mitakshara law applicable before 1956, the self-acquired property of a male devolved exclusively upon his male issue. This principle was supported by authoritative precedents.</p>\n\n<p>The Court concluded that since Rama Pai died before 1956, his self-acquired property devolved entirely upon his son, Hari Pai, who validly conveyed his rights to the defendants. Consequently, the court dismissed the appeal, upholding the judgment that the property was not partible. The decision restates the legal position concerning inheritance rights under the Mitakshara law before the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.</p>",

The ruling underscores that while grandparents can provide love, the mother, as the natural guardian, holds the inherent right and responsibility unless proven unfit.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose after the father's death, where the paternal grandparents sought guardianship of the minor child, whose custody had been granted to the father in a prior divorce decree. The mother filed a counter-application seeking custody, which was initially rejected. The High Court addressed whether the grandparents could claim custody in preference to the mother, citing Section 6(a) of the Act, which favors the mother as the natural guardian after the father's death, especially for children below five.</p>\n\n<p>The Court considered arguments from both sides, including the mother's improved financial stability and the child's established relationship with the grandparents. Justice Chapalgaonkar, reiterating the child's welfare as paramount, ruled in favor of the mother, citing precedents that a natural parent's custody should only be denied if they are demonstrably unfit. The Court granted custody to the mother while providing visitation rights to the grandparents, balancing the child's legal right to maternal care with the importance of maintaining family bonds.

The Bank of Baroda, however, presented evidence showing the transactions were initiated by the petitioners themselves using their login credentials, registered devices, and OTPs, with a password change following the transfers.</p>\n\n<p>The Allahabad High Court found that the evidence indicated the transactions were carried out by the petitioners, noting the use of their login, OTPs, and the addition of beneficiaries. The court also highlighted the delay in reporting the issue as inconsistent with genuine cyber fraud victims.

Therefore, corporate legal and compliance teams must integrate TCCCPR compliance into standard operating procedures, including regular audits, whitelisting tools, adherence to 1600-series numbers, and comprehensive staff training.</p>\n\n<p>The NCCL circular indicates a broader regulatory trend in India towards stricter consumer protection and digital security in corporate communications. By proactively aligning systems with TRAI's amendments, businesses can mitigate legal and operational risks, while strengthening consumer trust. Compliance must be a core component of operational strategy to protect consumers, uphold corporate integrity, and avoid regulatory and reputational fallout.</p>",

    "title": "Unravelling the Conflict: Insolvency Proceedings and Dishonoured Cheques",
    "description": "<p>This case summary details a criminal writ petition filed by Ortho Relief Hospital and Research Centre against M/s. Anand Distilleries and its Directors, following the dishonoring of a cheque issued as security for a loan. The hospital had extended a loan to the company, receiving a post-dated cheque as security. After periodic interest payments ceased, the hospital learned of insolvency proceedings initiated against M/s. Anand Distilleries under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IB Code).</p>\n\n<p>Despite the insolvency proceedings, the respondents requested that the cheque be presented, which was subsequently dishonored due to insufficient funds. A legal notice was issued, followed by a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (NI Act), and Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The trial court discharged the respondents from the Section 138 NI Act offense, citing the ongoing insolvency proceedings, leading to the hospital challenging this discharge order in the Bombay High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The central issue before the High Court was whether the initiation of insolvency proceedings under the IB Code prior to the filing of a complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act nullifies the latter proceedings. The Bombay High Court, referencing relevant Supreme Court judgments, ruled that the trial court had erred in discharging the respondents. The court emphasized that the moratorium for corporate debtors under the IB Code does not extend to the personal criminal liability of directors and individuals under the NI Act. Consequently, the High Court allowed the Criminal Writ Petition, quashing the trial court's orders and reinstating the complaint, reinforcing the principle that personal penal liability persists despite corporate insolvency proceedings.</p>",

    "title": "Foreign Currency Settlement System Framework Notified by IFSCA for GIFT IFSC",
    "description": "<p>On October 3, 2025, the International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) formalized the rules, bye-laws, and regulations for the Foreign Currency Settlement System (FCSS) in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT IFSC). This notification provides a clear legal and operational framework for settling foreign currency transactions within the IFSC. This enhancement provides regulatory clarity, risk management, and operational efficiency for market participants.</p>\n\n<p>The FCSS is established under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, with IFSCA authorizing CCIL IFSC Limited (CIL) to operate the payment system. IFSCA also notified CIL's bye-laws, rules, and regulations, making them legally binding. The framework aligns with the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019, empowering IFSCA to regulate payment systems within IFSCs. The International Financial Services Centres Authority (Payment and Settlement Systems) Regulations, 2024, provide specific operational guidance, solidifying the FCSS as a regulated settlement system in GIFT IFSC.</p>\n\n<p>The formalization of FCSS strengthens GIFT IFSC's infrastructure, enhancing its attractiveness to international financial institutions. By providing a domestic, regulated foreign currency settlement platform, the FCSS reduces dependence on offshore systems, enhancing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This will provide international banks, corporates, and financial institutions operating in GIFT IFSC with regulatory certainty, improved risk mitigation, and compliance clarity.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the IFSCA's notification codifies the legal and operational framework for foreign currency settlements in GIFT IFSC, laying a foundation for secure, efficient, and compliant cross-border transactions. This further enhances GIFT IFSC\u2019s position as a globally competitive financial hub.</p>",

    "title": "Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Wins In Supreme Court; Essar Power Liable To Reimburse Fixed Electricity Charges",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) in its dispute with Essar Power Limited (EPL) regarding the diversion of electricity to Essar Steel Limited (ESL) under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The case, stemming from a 1996 agreement for EPL to supply electricity to both GUVNL and ESL, centered on EPL's alleged breach of proportionate allocation by supplying more power to ESL than agreed, leading to claims of wrongful diversion.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute moved through multiple adjudicative bodies, including the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) and the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). Previous rulings had addressed issues such as capacity declaration, compensation for diversion, and the appropriate methodology for computing the diverted electricity. The Supreme Court's intervention became necessary to settle the matter.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of adhering to its 2016 decision, which established the proportionate allocation obligation and capacity declaration requirement under the PPA. A key aspect of the judgment was the entitlement of GUVNL to reimbursement of fixed charges for electricity diverted to ESL, distinct from compensation for diversion. The court also upheld the GERC's methodology for computing electricity diversion, using hourly periods until February 23, 2005, and half-hourly periods thereafter, acknowledging a subsequent consensual change implemented by both parties. Additionally, the court affirmed the method of calculating compensation for wrongful diversion, which is based on the HTP-1 Tariff Energy Charge rate reduced by variable costs. The Supreme Court upheld APTEL's decision to remand specific issues, such as discrepancies in Deemed Generation Incentive amounts, to GERC for further factual examination and determination. The ruling directed GUVNL to receive reimbursement of fixed charges and compensation for wrongful diversion, following the specified computation methodologies, and instructed each party to bear its own costs.</p>",

    "title": "Project Financing in India: A Comprehensive Overview",
    "description": "<p>Project financing is a critical mechanism for funding large-scale infrastructure and industrial projects in India, relying on projected cash flows rather than sponsor balance sheets. It has become increasingly important for India's economic growth as the country develops essential infrastructure. The project financing ecosystem in India consists of equity, debt, and government support mechanisms and is underpinned by both public and private sector investment, as well as growing institutional support.</p>\n\n<p>Project finance is widely used across multiple infrastructure sectors in India. However, despite its growth, this ecosystem faces several persistent and emerging challenges, including those related to the legal and regulatory framework.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends emphasize the need to strengthen project preparation, enhance risk-sharing mechanisms, deepen bond markets, promote dispute resolution reforms, and leverage innovative financing tools like InvITs, ESG bonds, and blended finance. As India aims for a $5 trillion economy, robust project finance mechanisms will be vital for mobilizing the necessary capital for sustainable infrastructure development.</p>",

    "title": "Music Legend Asha Bhosle Sues AI Firm and E-Commerce Sites Over Voice and Image Misuse",
    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court has granted ad-interim protection to playback singer Asha Bhosle, recognizing her personality rights against unauthorized use of her voice, image, and likeness by AI platforms and online marketplaces. This ruling sets a precedent in India's jurisprudence on deepfakes, AI exploitation, and publicity rights by acknowledging the legal protection of a celebrity's persona, extending to voice cloning, AI-generated content, and digital merchandise.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from the misappropriation of Asha Bhosle's voice, name, image, and likeness without her consent. AI platforms were developing tools to clone her voice, allowing users to generate songs in her style, which were then circulated on platforms like YouTube. Additionally, online marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart were selling unauthorized merchandise featuring her image. Bhosle argued these actions violated her personality rights and moral rights under Section 38-B of the Copyright Act, 1957.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court concluded that Bhosle had established a strong prima facie case, emphasizing the unauthorized technological exploitation of her identity and reputation. The court issued ad-interim injunctions, restraining the defendants from misusing her personality attributes.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment significantly shapes India's response to AI, deepfakes, and personality rights. It affirms that a celebrity's voice, name, and likeness are protectable attributes, and AI voice cloning without consent constitutes infringement. The ruling also places a duty on intermediaries like Amazon, Flipkart, and YouTube to remove infringing content and share violator details, strengthening accountability in the digital ecosystem. While this judgment provides immediate relief, it also exposes the regulatory vacuum in India regarding AI-generated content and digital impersonation, highlighting the need for comprehensive legislation on digital identity and AI misuse.</p>",

    "title": "Samsung Liable for Faulty Handset and Unfair Trade Practice: Delhi Consumer Commission Ruling",
    "description": "<p>The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission-I, Delhi, has held Samsung India Electronics and its authorized service center jointly liable for deficiency in service and unfair trade practice. The ruling stems from a case where a consumer's Samsung A35 smartphone developed defects shortly after purchase, and Samsung refused replacement or refund, despite its own \"Dead on Arrival\" (DOA) policy.</p>\n\n<p>The complainant, Mr. Doneshwar Arya, purchased the phone for \u20b930,999, and a defect appeared on the display within three days. The company denied relief based on a missing IMEI sticker, although the IMEI was verifiable. The Commission, referencing the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, particularly Section 2(47) and Section 2(11), found Samsung guilty of unfair trade practices and deficiency in service for failing to honor its DOA policy and creating arbitrary procedural requirements.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the Commission directed Samsung to refund the cost of the handset (\u20b930,999), pay \u20b910,000 as compensation for mental agony and harassment, and cover \u20b95,000 in litigation costs. The judgment reinforces consumer rights, emphasizing that companies must respect warranty commitments and provide fair and prompt redressal mechanisms. It sets a precedent that companies cannot evade liability through arbitrary hurdles and must act in good faith.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has issued a public notice alerting policyholders to a fraudulent website mimicking its consumer education portal. This fake site is designed to steal money and data by misleading users into believing it is the official IRDAI resource.</p>\n\n<p>The deceptive website, using the address `https://policyholdergov.org`, closely resembles the legitimate IRDAI portal, `https://policyholder.gov.in`, employing copied logos and seals to appear credible. Victims are urged to pay renewal premiums and are sometimes promised faster claim settlements in exchange for fees, which are fraudulent requests. IRDAI has clearly stated that it never collects premiums, charges for claim settlements, or offers payment gateways.</p>\n\n<p>IRDAI has reported the fraudulent site to cyber-crime authorities and CERT-In, but the site continues to reappear with new sub-links. Policyholders are advised to only use the official websites (`https://policyholder.gov.in` and `https://irdai.gov.in`) and to treat any other variations, WhatsApp links, or SMS short-codes with suspicion. A three-step safety checklist includes carefully verifying the URL, ensuring the presence of the padlock symbol and \"gov.in\" suffix, and avoiding entering sensitive data on sites accessed through search ads or unsolicited calls.</p>",
