    "title": "Pro-Knits Revisited: How the Apex Court Refines the MSME\u2013SARFAESI Tug-of-War",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court's judgment in *Shri Shri Swami Samarth Construction & Finance Solution v. Board of Directors, NKGSB Co-operative Bank Ltd.* clarifies the interplay between special insolvency measures for MSMEs and the SARFAESI Act. The case involved a borrower registered under the MSMED Act, 2006, who defaulted on a loan from NKGSB Co-operative Bank, leading to the account being classified as a non-performing asset (NPA). The borrower challenged the bank's actions under SARFAESI, citing non-compliance with the \"Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises\" issued in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The borrower argued that the 2015 Framework mandates lenders to identify incipient stress in MSME accounts before classifying them as NPAs, a duty allegedly not fulfilled by the bank. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, emphasizing that the Framework envisages a collaborative mechanism between lender and borrower. While banks are expected to identify stress, the MSME also has a responsibility to proactively engage the framework if it anticipates financial distress.</p>\n\n<p>The Court held that a bank, without conscious knowledge of the borrower's MSME status, can proceed with NPA classification and demand notices under Section 13(2) of SARFAESI. Upon receiving such a notice, the borrower can then assert its MSME status, triggering the lender's obligation to pause, examine the claim, and explore revival options if the Framework's conditions are met. The court distinguished the case from *Pro Knits v. Canara Bank*, emphasizing the MSME's duty to present authenticated material early in the process. Delaying the assertion of MSME status until late in the enforcement process, or after unsuccessful challenges in other forums, would not be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Court dismissed the writ petition, underscoring that Article 32 jurisdiction is not a substitute for statutory appellate remedies. The judgment reinforces that MSME borrowers must actively engage with the Framework to benefit from its protections, while lenders must be prepared to facilitate revival efforts once an MSME borrower properly invokes the Framework.</p>",

    "title": "Delhi High Court Clarifies Patent Infringement and Equitable Relief in Mold-Tek Case",
    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court's judgment in *Mold-Tek Packaging Ltd. v. Pronton Plast Pack Pvt. Ltd.* clarifies key aspects of patent infringement analysis and the standards for equitable relief in patent litigation, reinforcing the balance between protecting innovation and ensuring fair market competition. The case underscores the necessity of a proper \"product-to-patent\" comparison, where a defendant's product is assessed against the patent's claims rather than the patentee's product.</p>\n\n<p>The court reiterated the principles governing equitable remedies like interim injunctions, including the defendant's ability to raise a credible challenge to the patent's validity based on Section 107 of the Patents Act 1970. A credible challenge requires scientific material and expert evidence to demonstrate potential revocation under Section 64 due to lack of novelty or inventive step. The High Court criticized the lower court for incorrectly shifting the burden of proving novelty to the plaintiff and failing to properly evaluate prior art.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling emphasizes that once a plaintiff establishes prima facie infringement, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove the patent's vulnerability. The court also found no substantial evidence to support allegations of prior art suppression against Mold-Tek. This decision reaffirms essential doctrines in patent litigation, including rigorous infringement analysis based on claim interpretation, upholding the burden of proof standards, and preserving the equitable nature of injunctive relief. The judgment provides a crucial procedural and doctrinal foundation for patent litigation in India, particularly in sectors like pharmaceuticals, biotech, and manufacturing.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court's Analysis of Contributory Negligence and Future Income in Motor Accident Claims: *S. Mohammed Hakkim v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors.*",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India's decision in *S. Mohammed Hakkim v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors.* significantly impacts motor accident compensation law by enhancing the appellant's compensation to \u20b991.39 lakh. The court revisited the concept of contributory negligence and adopted a forward-looking approach to assess future earning potential, especially for students. This judgment clarifies the apportionment of liability among multiple parties and emphasizes that compensation should reflect the actual economic and social consequences of severe injuries.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from an accident where the appellant, an engineering student, suffered a severe injury resulting in the amputation of his leg after colliding with a car that braked suddenly, followed by being run over by a bus. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) initially awarded \u20b991.62 lakh, deducting 20% for contributory negligence. However, the Madras High Court increased the negligence to 30%, apportioned liability among the car driver, bus driver, and appellant, and reduced the overall award to \u20b958.53 lakh.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court scrutinized these findings, holding that while the appellant contributed to the accident by not maintaining sufficient distance and lacking a valid license, the car driver's abrupt braking on a high-speed highway was the primary cause. Consequently, the court apportioned negligence and recalculated the compensation based on the appellant's potential future income as an engineering graduate. Referring to precedents like *Navjot Singh v. Harpreet Singh*, *Sarla Verma v. DTC*, and *National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi*, the court fixed a notional income, factored in future prospects, applied an appropriate multiplier, and restored reduced attendant charges and increased compensation for loss of marital prospects, leading to a final compensation of \u20b991.39 lakh after factoring in the 20% contributory negligence.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's judgment reaffirms the importance of contextual and proportional evaluation of contributory negligence, particularly when another driver's recklessness is a major contributing factor. It underscores that compensation should comprehensively address both financial and social implications of life-altering injuries. The ruling reinforces the higher duty of care expected from drivers on highways, particularly regarding signaling intentions, and sets a precedent for future cases involving young victims and multi-vehicle accidents, blending legal rigor with a compassionate understanding of the law's purpose.</p>",

This intervention, framed against the backdrop of a compromised educational system that often prioritizes academic success over holistic well-being, draws on philosophical ideals of education and the constitutional right to life, which now encompasses mental well-being. The ruling aims to address systemic failures highlighted by a tragic case of a NEET aspirant's death.</p>\n\n<p>Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau indicate a concerning rise in student suicides, with 13,044 cases reported in 2022 alone. Recognizing suicide as a preventable tragedy, the Court addressed a specific case involving the suspicious death of a student, Ms. X, enrolled in a coaching center. Allegations of investigational lapses prompted the Supreme Court to transfer the probe to the CBI, overturning a previous High Court order.</p>\n\n<p>Invoking Articles 32 and 141, the Supreme Court issued binding mental health and suicide prevention guidelines for all educational institutions until formal legislation is enacted. This ruling, similar to the Vishaka Guidelines, recognizes mental health as integral to the right to life under Article 21 and imposes accountability on institutions. The judgment mandates an overhaul of student welfare mechanisms and mental health safeguards.</p>\n\n<p>The Court has directed the Union Government to file a compliance affidavit within 90 days, detailing implementation steps, regulatory rules for coaching centers, and monitoring frameworks. The judgment is a demand for justice in Ms. X\u2019s case and a blueprint for preventing further student suicides by reshaping India\u2019s educational environment to prioritize well-being alongside academic achievement.</p>",

State of U.P. and Others* addresses a property compensation dispute while also emphasizing elder rights and filial responsibility under the Indian Constitution. The court's interpretation of Article 21, informed by the Supreme Court's precedent in *Ashwani Kumar v. Union of India*, affirms the right of senior citizens to live with dignity.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a septuagenarian, Ram Dular Gupta, seeking the release of compensation for land acquired by the government. His sons filed objections claiming a share, but Gupta alleged they subjected him to physical and emotional abuse. The court found the sons were not dependent on their father and had been the subject of prior complaints.</p>\n\n<p>The court condemned the sons' conduct, holding that neglect, cruelty, or abandonment of elderly parents violates Article 21, which guarantees the right to life with dignity. It directed the release of the entire compensation to Gupta, dismissing the sons' objections and warning against further interference. The court reaffirmed that Article 21 extends beyond mere survival to include emotional well-being, emphasizing that a hostile home for an aging parent is a violation of constitutional rights. Citing *Ashwani Kumar v. Union of India*, the court highlighted the constitutional need to safeguard the rights of the elderly, interpreting social justice to encompass their protection and advocating for innovative applications of Article 21 to address their vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in actively enforcing the statutory and moral duty toward the elderly, affirming that dignity in old age is a non-negotiable right and courts will intervene when Article 21 rights are threatened, even within domestic settings.</p>",

This secure, dedicated cloud infrastructure aims to serve banks, NBFCs, and other regulated financial entities in India, aligning with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA), and India\u2019s broader digital policy objectives. The IFS Cloud is designed to meet RBI's data localization mandates, enhancing security and oversight in the financial sector.</p>\n\n<p>The IFS Cloud intends to provide a secure and scalable environment, hosted within India and tailored to regulated financial institutions. It aims to reduce compliance fragmentation and improve data governance. The DPDPA, 2023, allows cross-border data transfers but empowers the Central Government and sectoral regulators like the RBI to impose restrictions based on public interest or national security. The IFS Cloud supports RBI's localization mandates, providing a compliant domestic infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>RBI mandates that data related to core banking operations and payment systems be stored and processed exclusively in India. While DPDPA permits cross-border transfers, RBI can enforce stricter norms, leading to differentiated compliance obligations. India\u2019s sector-specific approach is more calibrated compared to China\u2019s strict \u2018local-only\u2019 model, balancing national security, regulatory control, and operational feasibility.</p>\n\n<p>The governance of the IFS Cloud may eventually shift to a consortium of financial sector stakeholders. The IFS Cloud seeks to bridge the digital capacity gap for NBFCs, cooperative banks, and smaller institutions by providing standardized, secure cloud infrastructure. This supports inclusive innovation, ensuring smaller players can participate in secure, cloud-based financial ecosystems. The initiative is expected to strengthen regulatory compliance while furthering India\u2019s goals of digital and economic sovereignty.</p>",

Sanmar Engineering Services Ltd.* reinforces the strict interpretation of acknowledgment under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963, emphasizing that acknowledgment must be clear, specific, and refer only to a present, subsisting liability to restart the limitation period. This judgment serves as a guard against diluting the limitation law, which ensures legal certainty and timely enforcement of rights.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a dispute over a contractual claim where the respondent acknowledged only a portion of the liability. The Supreme Court addressed the central issue of whether a partial acknowledgment could extend the limitation period for the entire claim. The Court held that Section 18 requires a written acknowledgment of liability, signed before the expiration of the prescribed period, to trigger a fresh limitation period.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized that Section 18 must be interpreted strictly, as limitation laws are substantive and prevent stale claims. An acknowledgment cannot extend limitation for a time-barred or unacknowledged claim, or for new or future claims. This ruling prevents the misuse of Section 18 by claimants attempting to revive entire claims through partial acknowledgments and reinforces the importance of ensuring that any acknowledgment relied upon is express, written, and acknowledges the full extent of the liability claimed.</p>",

The Magistrate in Mangalore and the High Court of Karnataka erroneously concluded they lacked jurisdiction, leading to the Supreme Court appeal.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court overturned the previous decisions, citing Section 142(2)(a) of the N.I.

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in *Ch. Joseph v. Telangana State Road Transport Corporation*, overturned the medical retirement of a bus driver who developed color blindness during his employment. The Court emphasized that the employer's failure to consider alternate employment options, despite a binding industrial settlement, violated principles of fairness, statutory obligations, and constitutional rights. This decision reinforces the importance of reasonable accommodation and the enforceability of industrial settlements under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.</p>\n\n<p>The appellant, Ch. Joseph, was retired after being found color blind during a routine medical check-up, despite a 1979 Memorandum of Settlement (MOS) mandating alternate employment for drivers with this condition. The corporation relied on internal circulars to justify the retirement. The Supreme Court ruled that the 1979 MOS was a binding, quasi-statutory instrument that was not overridden by a later, more general agreement. The Court also found that the internal circulars could not supersede the binding settlement. Moreover, the employer failed to assess Joseph's suitability for alternative roles.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court highlighted the constitutional and statutory duty to provide reasonable accommodation to employees acquiring disabilities during their service. It clarified that protection under Section 47 of the PwD Act must be interpreted broadly to promote inclusion and dignity. The Court directed the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation to reinstate Joseph in a suitable non-driving role with back pay and continuous service. This judgment reaffirms the rights of employees acquiring disabilities during service, emphasizing that settlements, statutory schemes, and constitutional principles cannot be undermined by administrative convenience.</p>",

Section 18 of the Act allows for the extension of the limitation period under specific conditions, requiring a written and signed acknowledgment of liability. However, the Supreme Court has clarified the application of Section 18, particularly concerning partial acknowledgments of debt.</p>\n\n<p>The Limitation Act is based on principles demanding timely pursuit of legal remedies within statutory periods. Section 18 provides a mechanism to reset the limitation period when specific conditions are met: an acknowledgment of liability made in writing, signed by the liable party, and made before the expiration of the prescribed limitation period. Fulfilling these conditions triggers a fresh limitation period computed from the acknowledgment's signing date.</p>\n\n<p>The key principle is that an acknowledgment of a partial debt only extends the limitation period for that acknowledged portion, not the entire claim.

This stance emphasizes the importance of due process and individual rights within criminal procedure, even amidst technological advancements.</p>\n\n<p>Section 35 BNSS, similar to the former Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code, requires individuals against whom there's a reasonable suspicion of a cognizable offense to receive a \"notice to appear.\" This notice offers an opportunity to cooperate with the investigation before potential arrest.

Central Bureau of Investigation proceedings. The State of Haryana argued that since the new BNSS allows electronic service for certain court-issued summons, the same should apply to police summons under Section 35 BNSS. The Court rejected this, distinguishing between the \"judicial act\" of a court summons and the \"executive act\" of a police notice, the latter directly impacting personal liberty. The Court observed that provisions like Sections 93 and 193 of the BNSS, which allow electronic communication for producing documents or forwarding reports, do not have the same immediate bearing on personal liberty as a Section 35 notice.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision safeguards personal liberty by requiring verifiable notice in criminal proceedings, preventing potential arbitrary actions by investigating agencies, and reinforcing the principles of natural justice.</p>",

    "description": "<p>On July 25, 2025, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued an advisory mandating that all food businesses, including restaurants, cafes, dhabas, and cloud kitchens, must display their FSSAI license in a location readily scannable by customers using their smartphones. This new directive leverages the existing QR code on FSSAI licenses, which links to the Food Safety Connect mobile application, enabling customers to easily verify license authenticity, report violations, and receive food safety alerts.</p>\n\n<p>The Food Safety Connect app streamlines the complaint process by automatically filling in the food business's details and allowing users to upload photos, videos, or text to support their reports, which are then directly sent to the relevant Designated Officer. This initiative simplifies compliance for businesses as they only need to ensure the license is prominently displayed and scannable. Digital businesses can simply paste the QR code or short link on their websites.</p>\n\n<p>This shift in regulatory philosophy empowers customers to participate in ensuring food safety, promoting transparency, and accountability. By scanning the QR code, customers can verify licenses, report issues, and even influence businesses to maintain high standards. The advisory reinforces existing regulations, clarifying that licenses must be visibly displayed, and failure to comply will result in penalties. The new mandate effectively integrates customers into the food safety inspection process, turning the FSSAI license into a dynamic portal for real-time feedback and enforcement.</p>",

The initiative aims to facilitate the retrieval of unclaimed dividends by alerting shareholders and guiding them through the necessary steps to update their KYC and nomination records before the dividends are transferred to the IEPF.</p>\n\n<p>The campaign addresses the issue of significant amounts of declared dividends remaining unclaimed due to shareholders' failure to encash warrants or maintain updated bank and identity details. After a seven-year period, these unclaimed dividends and the corresponding shares are transferred to the IEPF, making subsequent recovery a more complex process.</p>\n\n<p>Saksham Niveshak places responsibility on companies to proactively identify and inform affected shareholders, providing clear instructions for digital KYC completion and nomination updates. The IEPFA is also reinforcing its field units, including Niveshak Didi, Niveshak Panchayat, and Niveshak Shivir, to disseminate information, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. This endeavor aims to cultivate a well-informed investor community capable of asserting its entitlements.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) issued Circular No. 8/25/2025-PCB/Tech/7452 on July 1, 2025, to streamline environmental clearances for small and medium enterprises in Goa. The circular leverages the Water Act (1974), Air Act (1981), and Environment Act (1986) to introduce a graduated compliance system, utilizing self-certification for smaller units, third-party certification for larger operations, and automatic three-year renewals. The aim is to reduce delays and costs while maintaining environmental standards through targeted oversight.</p>\n\n<p>The circular differentiates regulatory oversight based on capital investment, using \u20b950 lakh as the threshold. Businesses investing less than this amount can obtain Consent to Establish (CTE) and Consent to Operate (CTO) through an online application and self-certification, eliminating physical inspections. Larger projects must use accredited environmental auditors for their applications.</p>\n\n<p>Irrespective of capital investment, CTEs can be auto-renewed for three-year terms with a simple online requisition. CTOs also benefit from automatic three-year extensions, with smaller units using self-certification and larger ones submitting third-party inspection reports. These auto-renewals are withheld from units facing closure orders or ongoing litigation, ensuring accountability. The reforms aim to strike a balance between promoting ease of doing business and maintaining environmental accountability.</p>",

    "description": "<p>On July 14, 2025, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) officially withdrew Form IP-1, a mandatory filing for Insolvency Professionals (IPs) accepting assignments under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. This action, formalized through Circular No. IBBI/CIRP/86/2025, is part of a broader digital transformation initiated with the Assignment Module in February 2025 and the introduction of forms CP-1 to CP-5 in May 2025, marking a shift towards dynamic, portal-driven governance.</p>\n\n<p>Form IP-1, introduced in August 2019, served as a reporting mechanism for IPs accepting various roles under the Code. Its purpose was to enable the IBBI to monitor assignments, detect conflicts of interest, prevent forum shopping, and gain a comprehensive view of the insolvency ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>However, the static nature of Form IP-1 proved insufficient for the fast-paced environment of insolvency proceedings. The Assignment Module, mandated in February 2025, provided a real-time reporting system for IP appointments, resignations, and replacements. This Module functions as a dynamic ledger, timestamping events, triggering compliance alerts, and interfacing with other modules.  The Assignment Module applies to all types of insolvency proceedings ensuring comprehensive oversight.</p>\n\n<p>The introduction of forms CP-1 through CP-5 in May 2025 further streamlined the process by replacing both the previous CIRP Forms 1-8 and Form IP-1.  These new forms, integrated within the same portal as the Assignment Module, provide the IBBI with end-to-end visibility throughout the entire insolvency process.</p>\n\n<p>This transition establishes a two-tiered reporting system: the Assignment Module for real-time updates and forms CP-1 to CP-5 for detailed information. By consolidating multiple filings into an integrated workflow, the IBBI has reduced redundancy and simplified compliance without compromising disclosure. The withdrawal of Form IP-1 signals the IBBI's emphasis on technology as a key component in achieving the Code's objectives, setting a precedent for other regulators.</p>",

This signals India's transition towards enforcing data privacy and cybersecurity governance. MeitY received 6,915 responses from various stakeholders and is now finalizing the regulatory framework to implement the law.</p>\n\n<p>The DPDP Act, enacted in August 2023, provides the framework for lawful processing of digital personal data. MeitY is developing standardized formats for privacy notices, consent mechanisms, and breach reporting, and preparing to establish the Data Protection Board of India. Additionally, MeitY is developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy to enhance cyber resilience and strengthen institutions like CERT-In and NCIIPC. Public awareness initiatives, including tools like Cyber Swachhta Kendra (CSK) and the website www.safeonline.in, are also being promoted. Until the DPDP Act is notified, the Information Technology Rules, 2011, will continue to govern data security obligations.</p>\n\n<p>This update marks a crucial point for compliance in India, urging businesses in sectors like e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and social media to prioritize internal readiness, especially those involved in profiling or cross-border data processing. The impending enforcement requires entities handling digital personal data to align with the new requirements, including reviewing data flows, updating privacy policies, implementing breach response protocols, and ensuring board-level oversight of data governance. MeitY's update signifies the move from legislative intent to enforceable statute, demanding swift action from businesses to comply with the upcoming ecosystem.</p>",

State of Tamil Nadu case, citing unreliable evidence and significant procedural lapses in the handling of DNA evidence. This judgment is not only a victory for the accused but also a watershed moment for Indian jurisprudence due to the Supreme Court's issuance of binding, nationwide guidelines for the collection, preservation, and use of DNA evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Prior to this ruling, India lacked uniform standards for DNA handling, leading to inconsistencies and breaks in the chain of custody. This made DNA evidence questionable or inadmissible, particularly in high-stakes cases. The case involved the rape and murder of a couple in 2011, where the prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and DNA reports linking the accused to the crime.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court identified critical lapses in the prosecution's case, including unreliable testimonies, vague confessions, unsubstantiated theories, and a broken DNA chain of custody. Recognizing the systemic risks posed by a lack of procedural uniformity, the Court issued detailed and binding directions for handling DNA evidence that must be followed across the country. This ruling and the associated guidelines are expected to have a transformative effect on the evidentiary landscape of criminal law in India.</p>",

Mrs. Saroj Tandon*, the Delhi High Court clarified that pre-institution mediation under Section 12-A of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015, is mandatory for commercial counter-claims, even if they do not contemplate urgent relief. The case involved a dispute over a lease agreement and the refund of a security deposit, where the defendant filed a counter-claim without undergoing pre-institution mediation.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court overturned the Trial Court's decision, emphasizing that a counter-claim is treated as a distinct and independent suit under the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore, it must comply with Section 12-A of the Act. The court referenced the Supreme Court's decision in *Patil Automation Pvt. Ltd. v. Rakheja Engineers Pvt. Ltd.*, which established the mandatory nature of Section 12-A, effective prospectively from August 20, 2022. The High Court highlighted the legislative intent behind pre-institution mediation, which aims to reduce the burden on courts and promote early settlements.</p>\n\n<p>While agreeing that Section 12-A applied to the counter-claim, the Court acknowledged that the counter claim was filed before the cut-off date of August 20, 2022 and therefore directed that it ought not to be rejected on the ground of non-compliance with the mandatory Pre-Institution Mediation. The judgment clarifies that counter-claims in commercial suits are procedurally the same as suits and must adhere to the same requirements, including pre-institution mediation, reinforcing the importance of this process for early dispute resolution in commercial matters.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Karnataka High Court's decision in *Google India Pvt. Ltd. v. Nayana Krishna* clarifies the boundaries of civil liability in defamation suits involving multinational tech companies and their Indian subsidiaries. The case addresses the crucial intersection of defamation law, intermediary liability, and corporate identity in the digital age.</p>\n\n<p>The suit was originally filed against 21 defendants, including Google India, alleging the dissemination of defamatory content. Google India sought to be removed from the suit, arguing the absence of specific allegations or evidence linking it to the defamatory acts. The trial court rejected this application, leading to Google India's appeal to the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court framed the key issues as whether Google India was a necessary party, whether the plaint contained sufficient detail to establish defamation, and whether Google India's corporate structure justified its inclusion given the content was hosted on platforms operated by distinct foreign entities. The court emphasized the need for specific pleadings detailing the defamatory material, context, and responsible entity. It reiterated that generalized claims are insufficient, especially concerning digital platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The court distinguished Google India from its parent company, Google LLC, noting Google India's role as a non-exclusive reseller of online advertising and provider of technical support. Absent evidence of direct involvement, the court rejected the assumption that shared branding equated to liability. The High Court ultimately allowed Google India's petition, setting aside the trial court's order and removing Google India from the suit, reasoning that its inclusion represented an abuse of process.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment reinforces the need for detailed pleadings in defamation cases and respects the distinct legal identities of domestic subsidiaries. It also aligns with global trends aimed at protecting intermediary platforms from unwarranted litigation, unless their role in unlawful acts is clearly substantiated under statutory frameworks. This decision serves as a vital precedent in the evolving landscape of digital defamation law and the limits of civil liability for online services and their regional affiliates.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Punjab and Haryana High Court, in a recent decision, has clarified that stamp duty on sale deeds should be assessed based on the market value prevailing on the date of execution and registration of the sale deed, not the date of the earlier agreement to sell. This ruling addresses a recurring issue under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, which governs stamp duty on property transactions.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's analysis centered on the interpretation of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, particularly Section 3, emphasizing that the duty is imposed on the instrument of conveyance itself. It relied heavily on the Supreme Court decision in *State of Rajasthan v. Khandaka Jain Jewellers*, which established that the relevant market value is that on the execution date of the conveyance deed. The Court distinguished precedents dealing with assignment deeds, finding them inapplicable to conveyances by sale.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court explicitly overruled a prior conflicting judgment, *Harvinder Pal Singla v. State of Haryana*, which had assessed stamp duty based on the market rate at the time of the agreement to sell. The Court reiterated that Section 3, in conjunction with Section 17, mandates that the sale instrument must be duly stamped at the time of execution, reflecting the then-prevailing market value. This decision provides clarity and ensures consistency in stamp duty application, aligning with Supreme Court precedent and serving as authoritative law within its jurisdiction.</p>",

The case originated from a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) initiated against the hospital chain in March 2019, followed by a liquidation order in February 2020, appointing a liquidator.</p>\n\n<p>The EPFO initially filed a claim of \u20b91.73 crore for unpaid PF dues, which the liquidator admitted and subsequently paid \u20b91.90 crore, treating employer and employee contributions as exempt from the liquidation estate. A revised claim of \u20b94.72 crore was later submitted by the EPFO in 2023, including additional dues, damages, and interest based on post-liquidation assessments. The liquidator rejected this additional demand, prompting the EPFO to file an application under Section 60(5) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, seeking priority payment of the balance \u20b92.82 crore.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLT sided with the liquidator, holding that assessments conducted after the liquidation order are void due to the moratorium under Sections 14 and 33(5) of the Code. While basic contributions remain protected, penal damages and interest arising from post-liquidation orders are not entitled to priority or exemption. The Tribunal dismissed the EPFO's application, limiting their claim to the \u20b91.90 crore already disbursed, effectively ending the dispute.</p>",

This comprehensive framework replaces the 2006 and 2018 bye-laws, aiming to standardize advertising practices, protect urban aesthetics, prevent unauthorized displays, and ensure transparent commercial exploitation of advertising spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Key regulatory features include structured licensing and registration for advertisers, with licenses valid for five years and subject to renewal. The allocation of advertising rights on notified roads and areas is conducted through public auction or tender via e-procurement, governed by the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act, 1999. Spatial restrictions and density norms are enforced, with minimum spacing requirements between hoardings and restrictions based on road width.</p>\n\n<p>The bye-laws also address ownership, taxation, and ground rent, stipulating that payment of advertisement fees to BBMP does not confer land rights and that advertisers must secure agreements with landowners. Environmental and safety compliance is mandated, requiring biodegradable materials and prohibiting plastic or PVC flexes, diesel generators, and disruptive illumination. Legacy advertisements are temporarily protected, while infrastructure advertisements are subject to separate tendering. Certain self-advertisements and advertisements by public utilities are exempt from fees under defined conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Enforcement mechanisms are codified, including penalties for non-compliance and removal of unauthorized displays. An Advertisement Regulatory Committee (ARC) oversees implementation, resolves disputes, and hears appeals. The bye-laws advance consumer protection by preventing misleading claims and ensuring public safety through structural stability requirements. Overall, the BBMP Advertisement Bye-Laws, 2024, represent a significant step toward structured commercialization of outdoor advertising, embedding transparency, environmental accountability, and public safety principles.</p>",

The Madras High Court's decision in *Ramkumar v. Union of India (2025)* offers insights into judicial expectations of intermediaries and the government in preventing access to child sexual exploitation content.</p>\n\n<p>Indian law, particularly Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, provides a \"safe harbor\" to intermediaries, protecting them from liability for third-party content if they exercise due diligence and act upon knowledge of unlawful content. The Supreme Court's decision in *Shreya Singhal v. Union of India* clarified that intermediaries are obligated to remove content only upon receiving a court order or notification from a government agency. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 further operationalize intermediary responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The *Ramkumar* case involved a film teaser allegedly depicting child pornography hosted on YouTube. The Madras High Court directed the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to remove the content, emphasizing the social responsibility of intermediaries and the urgency of child protection. The court prioritized the state's duty to act in cases of ongoing online harm, even without impleading YouTube LLC. This decision highlights a shift in judicial reasoning, prioritizing harm prevention over procedural technicalities in digital safety matters.</p>\n\n<p>This trend is mirrored in the Supreme Court's order in *X v.

This ruling complements *Ramkumar* by underscoring that constitutional rights to privacy and protection from digital abuse should guide intermediary responsibilities. Overall, intermediary liability jurisprudence in India is evolving from a passive safe-harbor approach toward a responsibility-driven framework, with courts interpreting statutory protections in light of fundamental rights and public interest. The *Ramkumar* judgment emphasizes that intermediaries cannot remain neutral conduits in cases of serious violations like child exploitation, and government agencies cannot abdicate their duty to act.</p>",

His heir, Metpalli Rajanna, had two children, Muthaiah and Rajamma, from his first marriage, and was later married to Lasum Bai. Lasum Bai claimed ownership based on a registered will executed by Rajanna and an oral family arrangement.

    "title": "Justice in Time: Allahabad High Court Orders Six-Month Limit on Maintenance Cases",
    "description": "<p>The Allahabad High Court, in *Smt. Anjali Singh vs. State of U.P. and Another*, has directed the Family Court, Gautam Budh Nagar, to conclude a pending maintenance case within six months, emphasizing the urgency of financial relief for deserted wives under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C. Justice Nalin Kumar Srivastava stressed the need for swift resolution in such cases, given the economic hardship faced by abandoned women, and underscored the responsibility of all actors in the justice system to avoid unnecessary delays.</p>\n\n<p>Maintenance under Indian law, primarily through Section 125 Cr.P.C., ensures financial support to spouses, minor children, or dependent parents unable to support themselves, irrespective of religion. To claim maintenance, a wife must demonstrate her husband's sufficient means and refusal to provide support; \"wife\" includes legally wedded and, in some cases, divorced, non-remarried women. Besides the Cr.P.C., maintenance claims can also be pursued under personal laws and special legislation like the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act and the Domestic Violence Act.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Anjali Singh, who filed a maintenance case in the Family Court of Gautam Budh Nagar, contending that her husband's delaying tactics prolonged the proceedings. Her counsel argued that the repeated adjournments amounted to judicial harassment, as she had no independent source of income and depended on the litigation's outcome.</p>\n\n<p>The Court observed that Section 125 Cr.P.C. cases directly concern the dignity and well-being of vulnerable women and children and should be handled with compassion and urgency. It emphasized that delays in maintenance matters deny justice and amplify the emotional and financial distress of women. The Family Court was directed to decide the case within six months, granting no unnecessary adjournments, conditional on the applicant's full cooperation.</p>\n\n<p>Recent trends in Indian maintenance law reflect increased judicial recognition of women's financial insecurity post-separation or divorce. Courts are increasingly setting time limits for resolution, proactively issuing interim maintenance orders, and using measures like salary attachment to ensure enforcement. Courts have also clarified that women can pursue maintenance under multiple legal frameworks simultaneously, provided there is no double recovery.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment matters because it recognizes that maintenance litigation is about restoring dignity and fairness, mandating a six-month deadline to aid similarly situated women nationwide. It broadens judicial responsibility to include all stakeholders, acknowledging that prolonged procedures can further victimize already suffering parties and promoting judicial accountability in family law litigation.</p>",

    "title": "Bombay High Court Acquits All 12 in 7/11 Mumbai Train Blasts Case",
    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court acquitted all twelve accused in the 2006 Mumbai train blasts case on July 21, 2025, reversing a 2015 trial court conviction. The ruling, delivered nearly two decades after the attacks that killed 189 and injured over 820, cited severe evidentiary and procedural flaws in the prosecution's case.</p>\n\n<p>The court found that the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had \"utterly failed\" to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Key issues included unreliable witness testimony and questionable investigative procedures. The High Court emphasized that guilt must be proven unequivocally, even in terror cases, and that coerced confessions and procedural lapses are unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>The acquittal raises significant questions about the ATS's investigative methods and the potential wrongful imprisonment of innocent individuals for nearly two decades. The State of Maharashtra is expected to appeal the judgment in the Supreme Court. The case highlights the urgent need for police reforms, independent review of terror investigations, and accountability mechanisms to prevent wrongful prosecutions, particularly where allegations of torture are involved. The judgment underscores the importance of upholding the rule of law, even when public sentiment presumes guilt.</p>",

    "title": "No Fresh Notice to Heirs Needed after Section 13(2), SARFAESI Served: Srinagar Bench Clarifies",
    "description": "<p>The Srinagar Bench of the High Court of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh recently addressed a case regarding the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002, specifically concerning the necessity of issuing a fresh Section 13(2) notice to the legal heirs of a deceased borrower. The case arose after Jammu & Kashmir Bank Ltd. initiated proceedings under Section 14 of the Act to take possession of a mortgaged property following the death of the borrower, Abdul Aziz Sofi, after a Section 13(2) notice had already been served to him during his lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>The legal heirs challenged the bank's action, arguing that a fresh Section 13(2) notice should have been issued to them, asserting that the proceedings violated principles of natural justice. The bank countered that Section 14 is a summary remedy focused on the secured asset and not a personal action against the borrower, emphasizing that the initial Section 13(2) notice was validly served.</p>\n\n<p>The Court ruled in favor of the bank, dismissing the writ petition. It clarified that the death of the borrower does not extinguish the bank's right to proceed against the mortgaged property, as the liability transfers to the estate. The Court emphasized that Section 14's provisos only require affirmation of compliance with Section 13(2) as it stood during the borrower's lifetime and do not mandate a second round of notices to the successors. While dismissing the petition, the judges added that the bank would consider any One-Time Settlement scheme application by the petitioners. The ruling underscores that SARFAESI focuses on the secured asset rather than the borrower's continued existence.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court Reinforces SARFAESI Shield: No Stay on Bank Possession Without Demonstrated Pre-Existing Tenancy",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court, in *PNB Housing Finance Ltd. v. Manoj Saha & Anr.*, reversed a Calcutta High Court order, reaffirming the primacy of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI Act), 2002. The case involved a tenant who failed to adequately demonstrate a pre-existing, protected tenancy prior to a property's mortgage and subsequent action under SARFAESI.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose when PNB Housing Finance initiated SARFAESI proceedings against a borrower who had mortgaged the property. A tenant on the property asserted rights under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997, after the bank took possession. The High Court initially restored possession to the tenant, but the Supreme Court overturned this decision.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized that the 2016 amendment to SARFAESI provides a complete code, requiring tenants aggrieved by Section 13(4) measures to apply to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) under Section 17(4A), and if necessary, appeal to the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal. The Court found that the tenant's evidence of continuous possession prior to the Section 13(2) notice was lacking. The court also cited *Bajarang Shyamsunder Agarwal*, clarifying protections for tenants under oral or unregistered agreements are limited to one year from the Section 13(2) notice.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling reinforces the statutory framework of SARFAESI, highlighting that High Court intervention under Article 227 is inappropriate when an effective statutory remedy exists. The Supreme Court directed the DRT to promptly resolve the pending application, confirming PNB Housing Finance's possession of the secured asset and underscoring the importance of adhering to the established SARFAESI process.</p>",
