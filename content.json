    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court has reaffirmed the rights of senior citizens under The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, in a case involving Chandiram and Sushila Hemnani, who sought the eviction of their son and daughter-in-law from their property due to a hostile living environment exacerbated by frivolous litigation.</p>\n\n<p>The elderly couple, owners of a bungalow in Maharashtra, had permitted their son and daughter-in-law to reside with them, but subsequent disputes led to significant harassment. After a Tribunal initially ordered the eviction, the Senior Citizens Appellate Tribunal reversed this decision, prompting the senior citizens to file a writ petition in the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court, referencing previous judgments and emphasizing the Act's intent to protect senior citizens, overturned the Appellate Tribunal's decision. The court highlighted the couple's ownership of the property and the daughter-in-law's failure to establish any legal right to reside there. The court directed the respondents to vacate the premises within 30 days and awarded costs to the petitioners. The judgment reinforces the importance of safeguarding the rights of senior citizens and ensuring their peaceful enjoyment of their property, setting a precedent for similar cases.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in *Vinod Infra Developers Ltd. v. Mahaveer Lunia & Ors.*, reaffirmed the legal principle that an Agreement to Sell (ATS), even with possession or payment, does not confer ownership rights to immovable property without a registered sale deed. The court emphasized that title transfer necessitates a registered conveyance and that claims based solely on unregistered ATS are unenforceable unless a suit for specific performance is filed.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a dispute where the appellant challenged the validity of sale deeds executed based on an unregistered ATS and power of attorney, arguing they were security for a loan and subsequently revoked. Despite the revocation, the respondents registered sale deeds. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, restoring the plaint, and asserted that revocation of the power of attorney voided the subsequent sale deeds. The Court reiterated that SA/GPA/WILL transactions do not constitute valid transfers and cannot substitute for a registered sale deed.</p>\n\n<p>The Court also clarified that a plaint with multiple causes of action cannot be rejected entirely if one relief is legally untenable. Furthermore, the Court held that ownership and title disputes fall under the jurisdiction of civil courts, not revenue courts, as revenue records are for fiscal purposes and do not confer title. This decision reinforces the importance of registered conveyance deeds for legally transferring immovable property and promotes transparency in real estate transactions.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The case of *Executive Secretary of District Health Society vs. K.S. Subha Karuthukhan* highlights the complexities of balancing employment contracts with public conduct expectations, particularly concerning the Tamil Nadu Government Servants\u2019 Conduct Rules, 1973. The legal dispute arose after a contractual employee's disengagement following allegations of misconduct stemming from a matrimonial dispute, raising questions about employment security, the definition of misconduct under service rules, and the extent of judicial intervention in employment decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The employee, initially appointed as a Dental Assistant on a contractual basis, was disengaged after being implicated in a criminal case related to a matrimonial dispute. While the writ court initially ruled in favor of the employee, arguing the personal dispute shouldn't affect his employment, the appellants contended that the employee's conduct violated the professional standards expected of public servants under the Conduct Rules, which permit disciplinary action for misconduct even outside the workplace. The respondent maintained the allegations were unrelated to his professional role and his performance was satisfactory.</p>\n\n<p>The division bench overturned the writ court's decision, emphasizing that public servants are expected to uphold integrity in both professional and personal lives, and misconduct under the Conduct Rules extends beyond workplace behavior to actions that could tarnish public service. The court acknowledged the respondent's contractual term had expired, making reinstatement untenable, and stressed judicial intervention in contractual employment matters should be cautious. The final decision affirmed the government's authority to initiate disciplinary measures for conduct violations, whether professional or personal, underscoring the judiciary's role in respecting administrative autonomy while ensuring fairness. This case serves as a precedent for interpreting misconduct and contractual obligations in public administration.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, in the case of NAGAR vs State of Maharashtra, addressed the conflict between urban development and environmental conservation in Mumbai. The case challenged the Maharashtra Government's policy allowing the use of public recreational spaces for slum rehabilitation, highlighting the need to balance housing with the preservation of open spaces.</p>\n\n<p>The legal challenge stemmed from a government notification and amendments to the Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) 2034, which permitted converting open spaces into housing zones. NAGAR argued this contravened the city's Development Plan and undermined urban health by diminishing vital recreational areas. The petition invoked constitutional principles, the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (MRTP Act), the Doctrine of Public Trust, Sustainable Development, and the Precautionary Principle.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court acknowledged Mumbai's housing shortage but emphasized the importance of public open spaces for well-being. It struck down the contentious provisions of Regulation 17(3)(D)(2), deeming them inconsistent with urban planning principles and constitutional mandates, and directed the State to revise housing policies to align with the MRTP Act. The judgment serves as a precedent for balancing urban development and environmental conservation, reaffirming the importance of preserving public spaces and integrating inclusivity with sustainability.</p>",

Shree Vinayaka Developers*. The case involved a dispute over a property transaction where the appellants, engaged in real estate brokerage, sought to purchase a plot but were denied the sale deed despite making payments.</p>\n\n<p>The NCDRC upheld the dismissal of the consumer complaint, citing the Supreme Court's precedent that purchases for commercial purposes do not qualify the purchaser as a \"consumer.\" The commission found that the appellants' transaction was part of their regular commercial activity, thus excluding them from consumer status under both the 1986 and 2019 Consumer Protection Acts.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the NCDRC addressed the issue of transacting with an individual partner of the developer firm, noting that the partnership deed required transactions to be conducted in the firm's name. Given allegations of fraud and the complex nature of the dispute, the Commission directed the appellants to pursue remedies in civil or criminal courts, as consumer forums are not suited for adjudicating such matters. This decision underscores the importance of evaluating the complainant's consumer status and the capacity in which parties contract, ensuring consumer forums focus on protecting genuine consumers rather than commercial operators or investors.</p>",

These regulations aim to streamline inquiry processes and penalty imposition under the Pharmacy Act, 1948, enhancing regulatory oversight and compliance within the pharmacy sector. The regulations define key terms, including \"Act,\" \"adjudicating officer,\" \"appellant,\" and \"appellate authority,\" to ensure clarity and uniformity in their application.</p>\n\n<p>The regulations outline procedures for filing complaints, which can be submitted electronically, via speed post, or in person using Form-I. Upon receiving a complaint, the adjudicating officer issues a notice (Form-II) to the respondent, specifying the alleged contravention and requiring a response within a specified period. The officer then decides whether to proceed with an inquiry, providing the respondent an opportunity to present evidence (Form-III). The officer can enforce attendance of individuals relevant to the case and may proceed in absentia if the respondent fails to appear. Penalties are imposed via written order specifying reasons and the contravened provision of the Act.</p>\n\n<p>An appeal process is also detailed, allowing aggrieved parties to file an appeal (Form-IV) to the appellate authority within 45 days. The appeal must include a copy of the adjudicating officer's order, a statement of facts, and grounds for the appeal. The appellate authority reviews the appeal, may request records, and must dispose of the appeal within 90 days of filing.</p>\n\n<p>Orders issued under these regulations must be dated, signed, and communicated to all parties, with penalties credited to the respective state pharmacy council's account. The regulations are issued under the powers conferred by Section 18(1) and Section 18(2)(i) of the Pharmacy Act, 1948, with Central Government approval, and published in the Gazette of India.

    "description": "<p>The Kerala High Court has initiated proceedings to address the unchecked use of single-use plastics (SUPs) in the state's ecologically fragile hilly tourist regions. Taking Suo-motu cognizance of the matter, the court reaffirmed the constitutional obligation to safeguard the environment and issued detailed directions for strict enforcement of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, effective from October 2, 2025. This intervention addresses the increasing plastic pollution in high-footfall tourist destinations despite existing state bans.</p>\n\n<p>The Court identified major hill stations as plastic pollution hotspots due to high tourist footfall. It imposed a complete ban on specific SUPs in these areas, exempting only larger plastic water and soft drink bottles. The ban extends to official events and private gatherings, covering items like plastic plates, cups, and straws. The court has instructed that licenses for establishments should now incorporate these restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>To facilitate the transition, the court prescribed viable eco-friendly alternatives and directed the establishment of clean water kiosks and refill stations. Local authorities are tasked with regular clean-up drives of rivers, canals, and backwaters, and must collaborate with voluntary organizations. Additionally, the court emphasized the enforcement of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) obligations, mandating producers, importers, and brand owners to manage post-consumer plastic waste effectively. The Chief Secretary and the Principal Secretary of the Local Self Government Department were directed to lead the implementation.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling strengthens the legal and constitutional framework for environmental protection in India, drawing upon constitutional provisions, environmental statutes, and delegated legislation. By reinforcing EPR, the Court aims to shift accountability upstream, embedding sustainability into the production and distribution cycle and promoting a circular plastic economy. The judgment provides a practical roadmap for sustainable environmental governance and sets a precedent for other states to follow.</p>",

    "title": "No Title Without Registration: Supreme Court Clarifies Ownership Under Indian Property Law",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India has reaffirmed that a registered instrument is mandatory for the transfer of immovable property. In *Mahnoor Fatima Imran & Ors. v. State of Telangana & Ors.*, the Court ruled that an unregistered agreement to sell, even if validated later, does not confer legal title. The decision arose from a dispute over land in Telangana, emphasizing that mere possession, if not lawfully established, cannot justify protection from dispossession under Article 226 of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved 53 acres of land originally part of a larger tract declared surplus under the Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings) Act, 1973. A cooperative society claimed to have purchased the land via an unregistered agreement in 1982, later \"validated\" in 2006. Subsequently, the society executed registered sale deeds to individuals who sought protection from dispossession, claiming unlawful takeover by the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC).</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court underscored the importance of the Registration Act, 1908, mandating registration for any document transferring rights in immovable property. The unregistered 1982 agreement, despite its \"validation,\" remained legally ineffective. The Court also pointed to conflicting versions of the agreement, casting doubt on its authenticity. The Court reiterated that only a registered sale deed confers ownership, referencing Suraj Lamp & Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana. Additionally, the petitioners failed to establish lawful possession and statutory vesting of the land in the State under land reform laws further negated any claim of ownership.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling has significant implications for legal practitioners, real estate stakeholders, buyers, developers, and financial institutions. It emphasizes the need for thorough due diligence, verifying documentation, legal history, and statutory status of land, ensuring every transaction is backed by a properly executed and registered sale deed. The Supreme Court ruling reinforces that registered ownership is the only valid foundation for title to immovable property, safeguarding against claims based on unregistered agreements or mere possession.</p>",

This decision was based on the Government of India's ban of TikTok due to concerns over national sovereignty, data privacy, and cyber safety under the Information Technology Act, 2000.</p>\n\n<p>TikTok argued that the Registrar's decision demonstrated a lack of consideration of the material presented and incorrectly invoked Section 9 of the Trade Marks Act. The court, however, found that Section 11(6) is illustrative, not exhaustive, allowing the Registrar to consider any relevant fact, including matters of public policy and constitutional values when evaluating applications for well-known status.</p>\n\n<p>The Court observed that while TikTok remains a registered trademark with statutory protection, the enhanced protection conferred by \"well-known mark\" status was not warranted given the ongoing ban. The decision reinforces that acknowledgment of a trademark as \"well-known\" requires compliance with domestic legislation, public interest considerations, and constitutional protections, and is not solely determined by global popularity.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Competition Commission of India's (CCI) order in *TT Friendly Super League Association v. Table Tennis Federation of India* establishes a significant precedent for applying competition law to sports governance in India. Delivered in December 2024, the ruling clarifies that the regulatory status and non-profit nature of sports bodies do not exempt them from antitrust scrutiny when they operate as market participants. The case addresses whether a regulator can also act as a competitor, with the CCI firmly stating they cannot.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a complaint by TT Friendly Super League Association (TTFSL), an organization running non-ranking table tennis tournaments, against a WhatsApp advisory issued by the Suburban Table Tennis Association (TSTTA). The advisory warned players against participating in unaffiliated events, threatening suspension from official tournaments. TTFSL alleged anti-competitive conduct under Sections 3 and 4 of the Competition Act, 2002. The CCI investigated the conduct of four associations, identifying relevant markets as the \"market for organizing table tennis events in Maharashtra\" and the \"market for regulating professional table tennis in India.\" All four associations were deemed \u201centerprises\u201d involved in economic activities.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission concluded that the associations abused their dominant positions, violating Sections 4(2)(a)(i), 4(2)(b)(i), and 4(2)(c) of the Competition Act, 2002. The WhatsApp advisory was considered a coercive directive restricting player participation in independent tournaments. Clauses within the Table Tennis Federation of India's Memorandum of Association (MoA) were also found to be overly restrictive and anti-competitive. Furthermore, TSTTA's conduct constituted vertical restraints under Section 3(4) of the Act, causing an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC).</p>\n\n<p>Despite the violations, the CCI refrained from imposing monetary penalties due to remedial measures undertaken by the associations and the fact that it was a first-time offense. Instead, a cease-and-desist order was issued under Section 27, warning of stricter consequences for repeat offenses. The ruling reinforces athletes\u2019 right to compete and signals a shift toward player-centric regulation, requiring federations to adapt to a more open sporting ecosystem. The ruling highlights the need for sports federations to align their practices with fair competition principles and replace restrictive policies with transparent governance frameworks. The verdict also supports market access, innovation, and athlete choice in the evolving landscape of Indian sports.</p>",

The case (Arbitration Application No. 41 of 2023) arose from a joint development MoU and subsequent agreement of sale concerning a 2-acre plot, where disputes emerged over payment obligations and project timelines.</p>\n\n<p>Urbanwoods Realty sought the appointment of an arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, while the respondents argued that termination of the MoU and agreement of sale nullified the arbitration clause. The court emphasized the doctrine of separability, affirming that an arbitration clause remains valid even if the main contract is terminated. The court's role under Section 11 is limited to verifying the existence of a prima facie arbitration agreement, without delving into the dispute's merits or contract validity.</p>\n\n<p>The court interpreted the MoU and agreement of sale as a single transaction. Despite the use of \"may\" in the agreement of sale's arbitration clause, the court concluded that the intention to arbitrate was clear when considering both agreements together. Objections regarding insufficient stamping were deemed issues for the arbitral tribunal to decide. The High Court appointed Sri Justice V. V. S. Rao as the sole arbitrator, tasking the tribunal with resolving all issues, including the termination of the underlying agreements. This ruling underscores the importance of well-drafted arbitration clauses and the court's commitment to upholding arbitration as an efficient dispute resolution mechanism.</p>",

In *Zahhad & Anr. v. State of Kerala & Ors.*, Justice Ziyad Rahman directed the Kozhikode Corporation to issue a birth certificate identifying the couple simply as \"parents,\" instead of \"father\" and \"mother.\" This decision marks a significant step towards inclusive family law in India, offering hope for queer and transgender families.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose after Zahhad, a transgender man, gave birth to a child with Ziya Paval, a transgender woman. Despite their legal recognition as transgender individuals, the child's initial birth certificate designated Zahhad as \"mother\" and Ziya as \"father,\" contradicting their identities. The couple sought the court's intervention to be recognized as \"parents\" to avoid potential psychological, legal, and social consequences for their child.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Rahman grounded his decision in Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution, emphasizing equality, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, and the right to life and dignity. The court adopted a \"social context adjudication\" approach, asserting its constitutional responsibility to ensure equality when strict legal interpretations lead to injustice. The ruling signifies a monumental stride for the LGBTQIA+ community in India, as it acknowledges transgender parenthood and strengthens constitutional values of equality, dignity, and non-discrimination.</p>",

The central issue was whether IndiaMART's use of the trademark \"PUMA\" as a brand keyword on its B2B marketplace constituted trademark infringement, given that the platform facilitated listings that potentially included counterfeit PUMA goods.</p>\n\n<p>PUMA contended that IndiaMART facilitated the sale of counterfeit goods by allowing sellers to use the \"PUMA\" mark as a keyword, infringing on their registered trademark. IndiaMART argued that it operated as an intermediary under Section 2(1)(w) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, providing a platform for sellers without altering their content, and therefore should not be held liable for third-party listings.</p>\n\n<p>The court overturned the Single Judge's order, stating that offering \"PUMA\" as a brand keyword did not inherently constitute trademark infringement under Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The court emphasized that IndiaMART provided listing services and was not directly involved in the sales transactions between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, the court affirmed IndiaMART's immunity as an intermediary under Section 79(1) of the IT Act, as it did not originate or modify the content and took down infringing listings upon notification.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment reinforces the principles established in *Shreya Singhal v.

Srivastava\u2019s husband due to complications from rabies, covered under a Personal Accident Insurance Policy.</p>\n\n<p>IFFCO Tokio rejected the claim, arguing that the policy covered events like road accidents and burns, not infectious diseases. However, the Commission found no specific policy clause excluding rabies or viral infections. They reasoned that the policy's definition of \"injury\" as an accidental bodily injury caused by external, violent, and visible means could encompass a rabies infection resulting from an animal bite. This interpretation aligns with legal precedents, including a Supreme Court ruling that snakebites qualify as accidental deaths under such policies.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission invoked the \"contra proferentem\" rule, stating that ambiguities in insurance contracts must be interpreted in favor of the policyholder. They concluded that IFFCO Tokio's repudiation lacked justification and constituted a deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act. The Commission directed IFFCO Tokio to pay the insured amount, compensation for mental anguish, and litigation costs. This decision underscores the importance of clear policy language and fair claim handling by insurers, particularly in cases of personal loss, and highlights that consumer forums will intervene when policyholder expectations are not met.</p>",

This initiative aims to enhance regulatory oversight and improve transparency, particularly in on-lending or refinance arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>Established under the SARFAESI Act, CERSAI maintains a central registry of charges on movable, immovable, and intangible assets. The new mandatory fields introduced by CERSAI include the type of lending (direct lending, on-lending, or refinance), the Entity ID of the original lending institution (e.g., NABARD, NHB, SIDBI) in on-lending or refinance scenarios, and the Security Interest ID of the corresponding registration where refinance or on-lending is secured by a prior charge.</p>\n\n<p>This development has significant implications for banks, NBFCs, housing finance companies, and other lending institutions, requiring them to adapt their processes to capture and report the source of funds accurately. Proactive preparation will be essential for institutions to reduce compliance risk and ensure the continued legal enforceability of their secured interests. The objective is to bring greater clarity and control over lending chains and fund flows, particularly in multi-layered credit structures.</p>",

This ruling emerged from a habeas corpus petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, addressing the alleged unlawful detention and coercion of a woman by her family due to her sexual orientation. The court's decision emphasizes personal liberty, autonomy, and an evolving understanding of family, reflecting a progressive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights within the existing legal framework.</p>\n\n<p>The case was initiated by a petitioner seeking the release of her partner, who was allegedly being held against her will and subjected to coercive measures aimed at altering her sexual orientation. This was considered within the context of evolving LGBTQIA+ jurisprudence, particularly landmark judgments like NALSA v. Union of India and Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India, which decriminalized consensual same-sex relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Justices G.R. Swaminathan and Justice V. Lakshminarayan ruled in favor of the petitioner, asserting the detainee's right to make her own life choices. The court reiterated that the concept of family extends beyond traditional definitions to include chosen families, underscoring personal autonomy as a cornerstone of dignity and freedom. The judiciary's role in safeguarding the constitutional rights of marginalized communities, including LGBTQIA+ individuals, was also emphasized.</p>\n\n<p>The court also cited Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, guaranteeing the right to life and personal liberty, and referenced the Yogyakarta Principles advocating for the universal enjoyment of human rights, including the right to form families free from discrimination based on sexual orientation. The court allowed the detainee to leave with the petitioner and ordered the police to ensure the couple's safety and address complaints from the LGBTQIA+ community promptly. This decision marks a significant step in recognizing and protecting the rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals in India, emphasizing the importance of judicial intervention in the absence of legislative recognition for same-sex marriage.</p>",

It further stated the appellant failed to file an affidavit under Section 156(3) CrPC.

It noted inconsistencies in the High Court's reasoning, particularly concerning the appellant's intent and the absence of third-party verification during the gold revaluation. The Supreme Court restored the FIR, directing the trial court to proceed with the matter according to the law, and emphasized that its decision was not a reflection of the merit of the allegations.

    "description": "<p>On June 4, 2025, the Supreme Court of India delivered a judgment in a case involving the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) and homebuyers Anupam Garg and Rajiv Kumar. The case centered on delays and unilateral changes in the 'Purab Premium Apartments' housing project, initiated in 2011. The court examined the legal obligations of developers and the rights of consumers under Indian law.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose after delays in the project's completion beyond the initial possession date of May 21, 2015. Anupam Garg, an allottee, filed a consumer complaint citing a lack of progress and unilateral changes. The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) initially ruled in favor of Garg, directing GMADA to refund the deposited amount with interest, compensation, and the interest paid on Garg's loan.</p>\n\n<p>GMADA appealed to the Supreme Court, contesting its liability for the loan interest. The Supreme Court, referencing precedents like *Bangalore Development Authority v. Syndicate Bank* and *GDA v. Balbir Singh*, ruled that GMADA was not liable for the homebuyers' loan interest. The Court deemed the already awarded 8% interest sufficient compensation for the delay, emphasizing that compensation must be based on specific losses or injuries suffered by the consumer.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision clarifies the extent of a developer's liability in cases of project delays, setting a precedent for future disputes.

    "description": "<p>India's burgeoning quick commerce sector, characterized by companies promising deliveries in 10 minutes or less, faces substantial legal and regulatory hurdles. These challenges range from zoning violations due to strategically located \"dark stores\" in residential areas to food safety concerns and questions surrounding the rights and classifications of gig workers as \"independent contractors\". The article also considers the impacts on cost per order, profitability, and service fees on consumer interests.</p>\n\n<p>Regulatory compliance remains a major concern. Quick commerce platforms, often classified as IT companies, navigate grey areas to sidestep stringent retail regulations and labor laws which enable them to engage in predatory pricing practices. This has prompted investigations from the Competition Commission of India (CCI).</p>\n\n<p>The sector also grapples with economic sustainability. High operational costs and initially low average order values (AOV) present profitability challenges. While some platforms have managed to increase their AOV, this often involves offering higher-value product categories, each bringing its own regulatory and compliance complexities. Service fees and packaging costs further impact consumer interest and raise concerns from consumer protection agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer protection is another critical area of focus. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) scrutinizes delivery time claims and addresses issues like differential pricing based on device type. The CCPA is also cracking down on \"dark patterns\" through self-audits required of e-commerce platforms, designed to promote ethical and transparent user interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the gig worker model employed by many quick commerce platforms has been under the scanner. Concerns arise regarding fair working conditions, lack of social security benefits, and pressures leading to unsafe practices. States like Rajasthan and Karnataka are introducing ordinances and acts to protect gig workers' rights and ensure welfare.</p>\n\n<p>Food safety is also a major area of regulatory focus. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has issued comprehensive guidelines and licensing requirements for e-commerce food businesses, addressing concerns over hygiene and standards. Compliance is critical, with penalties for violations.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, compliance with Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodity) Rules, 2011, is crucial to prevent misleading practices in quantity declaration and product labeling. Similarly, data privacy concerns arise from the vast amounts of consumer data collected by these platforms, with the Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, aiming to regulate data collection, usage, and storage.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail e-commerce in India is allowed up to 100% under the automatic route for marketplaces, while inventory-based e-commerce is not permitted, balancing the need for foreign capital with the protection of domestic businesses. Lastly, ensuring quality standards through hallmarking and adherence to BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) is essential for products like jewelry and electronics to protect consumers from substandard goods.</p>",

Union of India* directed the Central Government to fully reimburse \u20b922,08,440 to Mr. Nansi, a retired government employee, for a heart transplant conducted at a private hospital. The court emphasized the primacy of Article 21 of the Constitution, safeguarding the right to life, in cases where essential medical treatment is unavailable through government-sponsored channels.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from Mr. Nansi's urgent need for a heart transplant due to severe cardiomyopathy. Because no Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS)-approved hospital in Mumbai was equipped to perform the procedure at the time, he underwent the transplant at a private facility. The CGHS authorities initially approved a reimbursement based on an outdated CGHS-Mumbai rate of \u20b969,000, which was significantly lower than the actual expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court strongly criticized the CGHS's narrow, technical approach, asserting that rigid procedural compliance should give way to compassion and constitutional values in life-saving situations. The court highlighted that heart transplants are inherently urgent, the right to health is integral to Article 21, and the government has the power to relax guidelines in medical emergencies. It also emphasized that the lack of empanelled facilities cannot justify denying essential care and questioned the outdated and discriminatory reimbursement rates. The judgment reinforces that public health policies must prioritize the well-being and constitutional rights of individuals, especially in critical medical situations.</p>",

He sought permission to return to the US, where he is employed. The Sessions Court initially rejected his plea, citing potential disruption to the investigation and mediation.

The case stemmed from Harinagar Sugar Mills Limited's (HSML) closure of its biscuit division following the termination of a long-standing job work agreement with Britannia Industries Limited (BIL).</p>\n\n<p>HSML applied for closure, but the Government of Maharashtra requested additional information, which HSML provided. When the authorities requested resubmission, HSML argued that closure permission was automatically granted per Section 25-O(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, due to the government's failure to respond within 60 days. The Bombay High Court dismissed HSML's petitions, deeming the application incomplete.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, holding that the initial request for information was not an order and the Deputy Secretary lacked the authority to request resubmission. The Court emphasized that the right to close a business is intrinsic to the right to conduct business under Article 19(1)(g), albeit subject to reasonable restrictions in the public interest under Article 19(6). The Court ruled that the 60-day period for deemed closure should be calculated from the initial application date, implying closure approval.

Loan-to-Value (LTV) caps have been introduced and must be maintained throughout the loan tenure, alongside standardized assaying and valuation procedures.

The Court ruled that the personal appearance of a Branch Manager is not mandatory for proving bank records. Any duly authorized bank official with access to the necessary records is competent to testify, thereby overturning a Trial Magistrate's overly strict procedural interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a Section 138 complaint where a cheque was dishonored due to insufficient funds. When the complainant presented an authorized bank representative in lieu of the Branch Manager, the Trial Magistrate refused to record their testimony, demanding a formal substitution application. The High Court found this insistence on procedural formalities to be excessive and legally incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Sanjay Dhar clarified that any responsible bank officer with access to account records in the ordinary course of business can testify to documentary evidence, such as cheque return memos, without needing personal knowledge. The Court also deemed the invocation of Section 302 of the Criminal Procedure Code unnecessary, as it obstructs the summary nature of Section 138 proceedings.

The court emphasized that maintenance calculations should be based on the husband's earning capacity and gross income, excluding voluntary expenses, thus safeguarding dependent spouses and children from attempts to evade maintenance responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a marital dispute where the wife sought interim maintenance after the husband filed for divorce. The Family Court ordered the husband, with a declared monthly income of \u20b947,000, to pay \u20b915,000 monthly for the wife and child. The husband challenged this, arguing reduced disposable income due to loan obligations and insurance payments. The High Court rejected these arguments, stating that voluntary financial obligations cannot supersede the primary duty to maintain dependents.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's analysis aligned with the Supreme Court\u2019s stance in *Manish Jain v.

The court also found the wife's unemployment to be genuine due to caregiving responsibilities, consistent with *Shailja & Anr. v. Khobbanna*, which affirms a qualified wife's entitlement to maintenance if she's not earning due to legitimate duties. The ruling reinforces the judiciary's commitment to protecting the financial well-being of spouses and children post-separation. Voluntary personal expenses cannot reduce statutory maintenance.

The respondents countered that the KER primarily addressed corrections to dates of birth, limiting the Commissioner of Examinations' authority to make broader changes.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court interpreted Rule 3(1) of Chapter VI of the KER to encompass alterations beyond just the date of birth, extending to personal details like name, religion, and caste. The court directed the respondents to amend the petitioner's educational records to accurately reflect his chosen name and religion, underscoring the principles of personal liberty, self-determination, and the right to an accurate representation of one\u2019s chosen identity in official documents.</p>",

    "description": "<p>On May 30, 2025, the Government of Karnataka enacted the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply, and Distribution) (Karnataka Amendment) Act, 2024, amending the COTPA, 2003. Key changes include raising the legal age for purchasing tobacco products from 18 to 21 years and increasing the maximum fine for violations from \u20b9200 to \u20b91,000. The legislation aims to strengthen tobacco control and reduce consumption, particularly among youth.</p>\n\n<p>The amendment broadens the prohibition of tobacco use in public places to include both smoking and spitting, while allowing designated smoking areas in larger hotels, restaurants, and airports that meet specific requirements. A complete ban on hookah bars has also been introduced, reflecting the state's effort to regulate tobacco consumption in social environments. The sale of tobacco products is now restricted to individuals 21 years and older, and increased scrutiny will be applied to sales near educational institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Significant penalties have been introduced for operating hookah bars, including imprisonment from one to three years and fines ranging from \u20b950,000 to \u20b91,00,000. Dr. U.S. Vishal Rao, a member of Karnataka\u2019s High-Powered Committee on Tobacco Control, believes these amendments are a crucial step in curbing tobacco use among the younger population. Bengaluru Police Commissioner B. Dayananda has emphasized strict enforcement, urging establishments to adhere to COTPA guidelines for designated smoking areas.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India dismissed writ petitions filed by Vodafone Idea Ltd. and other telecom operators, reaffirming the finality of its previous rulings on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues. The petitions, filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, challenged the imposition of interest, penalties, and interest on penalties related to AGR.</p>\n\n<p>The core issue stems from differing interpretations of AGR between telecom operators and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). A 2019 Supreme Court judgment sided with the DoT, significantly increasing the financial liabilities of telecom companies. While the Court allowed payment in ten annual installments in 2020, the operators sought further relief in 2025, arguing that interest and penalties were economically unsustainable.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court bench dismissed the petitions, emphasizing that Article 32 cannot be used to reopen conclusively decided matters. The Court underscored the importance of judicial discipline and the finality of its judgments, signaling that the remedy for economic grievances lies in policy engagement, not repeated litigation. This decision reinforces legal certainty for the telecom sector, urging companies to focus on operational stability and financial restructuring within the established framework of AGR liabilities and payment timelines.</p>",

The Controller had cited Section 3(b) of the Patents Act, 1970, expressing concerns about public health and morality related to the device's potential use, particularly given the Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized that patent denials based solely on moral or public health grounds require independent scientific or technical evidence, and subjective notions are insufficient justification. The Controller's assumption that the invention was exclusively intended for tobacco products was incorrect, as the device could be used with various substrates.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Ravi Krishnan Kapur clarified that the e-cigarette ban addresses commercial activities, not the inherent patentability of an invention. Furthermore, the Controller's reliance on undisclosed documents violated principles of natural justice, denying ITC an opportunity to respond and rendering the decision procedurally flawed. The court has reaffirmed that bans on sale or distribution of products do not automatically equate to a ban on innovation and that health regulations should not unduly influence patent decisions.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the High Court set aside the Controller's order and remanded the matter for a fresh decision, stressing the need for a hearing and adherence to scientific and technical grounds. This ruling underscores the importance of relying on evidence-based assessments in patent law and establishes a narrower interpretation of Section 3(b), reinforcing the separation between health regulations and patent eligibility.</p>",

    "title": "Breaking the Mold: Can Courts Now Rewrite Arbitral Awards?",
    "description": "<p>In *Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd.*, a Supreme Court Constitution Bench addressed the power of Indian courts to modify arbitral awards under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The 4:1 majority held that limited judicial modification is permissible in specific circumstances, including clerical errors, severable portions, post-award interest, and under Article 142. This departs from the earlier decision in *NHAI v. Hakeem*, raising concerns about judicial overreach and its impact on the finality and autonomy of arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from conflicting judicial opinions regarding the power of Indian courts to modify arbitral awards, with some allowing it and others ruling against it. The Supreme Court aimed to resolve whether courts can modify awards or only set them aside. The Arbitration Act, modeled on the UNCITRAL Model Law, emphasizes limited court intervention, primarily allowing courts to set aside awards on specific grounds. However, the *Balasamy* ruling permits modifications in limited cases, sparking debate.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters argue that limited judicial modifications promote judicial economy and prevent delays. Opponents maintain that such powers conflict with the legislative intent of the Arbitration Act, potentially undermining arbitration's core principles and inviting further litigation. The ruling endorses judicial modifications under narrow circumstances and constitutional powers under Article 142. This interpretation has raised concerns about the integrity and indivisibility of arbitral awards, as well as potentially breaching the separation of powers.</p>\n\n<p>The majority's expansive view of Section 34 risks tactical litigation, weakens tribunal authority, and erodes arbitration\u2019s finality. Arbitral awards are generally unified instruments, and selectively modifying them compromises their coherence. Justice K.V. Viswanathan's dissent underscores that Article 142 cannot override clear statutory provisions, stressing judicial restraint and respect for legislative boundaries. Ultimately, the *Balasamy* decision introduces a nuanced approach, allowing limited court modifications, including severing invalid portions, correcting errors, modifying post-award interest, and invoking Article 142 to ensure complete justice.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in the case of *Kashmiri Lal Sharma v. Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board*, addressed the issue of retirement age disparities among employees with disabilities. The appellant, a 60% locomotor-disabled electrician, challenged his retirement at age 58, arguing it violated Article 14 of the Constitution due to an earlier Office Memorandum (OM) that allowed visually impaired employees to work until 60. The State later withdrew this OM, reverting the retirement age to 58 for all categories.</p>\n\n<p>The Court reaffirmed that setting the retirement age is a policy decision within the executive's purview, subject to the principles of equality. The appellant contended that the disparity violated Article 14 and that he had a legitimate expectation to work until 60 due to the OM's earlier existence. Conversely, the State argued that the OM's withdrawal negated any claims for extended retirement.</p>\n\n<p>Referencing the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 1995, and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016, the Court emphasized the need for equal treatment regarding employment benefits for individuals with benchmark disabilities. While partially allowing the appeal, the Court ruled that the appellant was entitled to full wages and benefits until the OM's withdrawal date (November 4, 2019) and that his pension should be calculated accordingly. The Court firmly stated that employees do not have a vested right to continue employment beyond the date of the OM's withdrawal, reinforcing the executive's right to determine retirement age through policy decisions, while still adhering to constitutional principles of fairness and equality.</p>",

This ruling underscores the importance of Section 65 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, which safeguards against the abuse of the Code's process.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a dispute where the Appellants initiated CIRP under Section 7, claiming to be financial creditors. The Respondent argued that the CIRP was a fraudulent attempt to defeat ongoing litigation related to the illegal dilution of their shareholding. The Adjudicating Authority terminated the CIRP, citing collusion, document fabrication, and misuse of the insolvency process.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT affirmed the NCLT\u2019s findings, emphasizing that the existence of debt and default does not shield a Section 7 application from scrutiny under Section 65 when collusion or abuse is proven. The Tribunal found significant documentary inconsistencies, violations of corporate law, manipulation of timing, and corroborative evidence of fraud. The Court clarified that terminating the CIRP was an adjudication on fraud and not a review of the admission order.</p>\n\n<p>This decision reinforces the judiciary's commitment to preventing the strategic abuse of the IBC, 2016. While Section 7 allows creditors to initiate CIRP based on financial debt and default, this mechanism is subject to scrutiny. Section 65 empowers the Adjudicating Authority to annul proceedings tainted by fraud or bad faith, thereby protecting the integrity of the Code.</p>",

It provides a legal basis for social security, occupational health and safety, transparency in automated monitoring systems, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms. A \"gig worker\" is defined as an individual performing work based on a contract with a specified rate of payment, typically through a digital platform. Platforms are digital arrangements that assign tasks, while aggregators are digital intermediaries. A welfare fee, ranging from 1% to 5% of a worker's payout, will be levied on platforms to fund these entitlements.</p>\n\n<p>To administer the ordinance, a dedicated Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers Welfare Board will be established, comprising government officials, worker and aggregator representatives, civil society members, and technical experts. This statutory body, headquartered in Bengaluru, will have the power to acquire assets, enter into contracts, and initiate legal action. Platforms are required to register with the Board, provide fair contracts, and ensure transparency in algorithmic management.</p>\n\n<p>A Karnataka Gig Workers Social Security and Welfare Fund will be created, financed by welfare fees, voluntary contributions, government grants, and other permitted sources.

    "description": "<p>The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued an advisory on May 28, 2025, addressing the potentially misleading use of the term \u201c100%\u201d on food product labels and promotional materials. The FSSAI has observed an increase in the use of this term, which, although seemingly straightforward, is ambiguous and can convey a false sense of absolute purity or superiority, potentially misleading consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Issued under the authority of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and referencing the Food Safety and Standards (Advertising and Claims) Regulations, 2018, the advisory highlights that claims must be truthful, unambiguous, and not misleading. Sub-regulation 10(7) of these regulations strictly prohibits any advertisement or claim that undermines other manufacturers or influences consumer perception in a misleading manner.</p>\n\n<p>The advisory directs all Food Business Operators (FBOs) to discontinue the use of the term \u201c100%\u201d on food product labels, packaging, and promotional content, whether used alone or with other descriptors. The FSSAI emphasizes that the term is undefined in the FSS Act, 2006, or its related regulations, and its use can lead to consumer confusion and misinterpretation. This measure is intended to prevent misleading claims, ensure transparency and accuracy in marketing practices, and maintain high standards of food safety and consumer protection within the food industry.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court has terminated the mandate of a sole arbitrator in the case of *Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited vs Sopan Projects*, citing an unacceptable delay of over eight years in delivering the arbitral award. This decision underscores the judiciary's dedication to the timely resolution of disputes through arbitration, as mandated by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a 2010 Work Order between Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited (Petitioner) and Sopan Projects (Respondent) for the construction of an underground MDPE pipeline. Disputes arose when the Respondent allegedly abandoned the project before completion, leading to the invocation of arbitration in October 2015. A sole arbitrator was nominated, and final arguments concluded in March 2020. However, with no award issued after three years, the Petitioner sought termination of the arbitrator's mandate under Section 14 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>\n\n<p>The Petitioner argued that the delay contravened public policy, while the Respondent contended that unpaid fees and periods covered by a Supreme Court order justified the delay. The Respondent also claimed the Petitioner did not attempt to follow up with the arbitrator.</p>\n\n<p>The Delhi High Court, referencing Section 14 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and previous Supreme Court rulings, emphasized the importance of expeditious arbitration proceedings. The court concluded that the arbitrator's unexplained three-year delay warranted termination of their mandate, reinforcing the necessity for efficient dispute resolution in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Director General of Health Services, CDSCO, issued a guidance document on May 26, 2025, providing detailed instructions for the safe and responsible disposal of expired and unused medicines. Prompted by concerns raised by researchers and discussions within the Drugs Consultative Committee (DCC), the document aims to mitigate ecological and public health risks associated with improper pharmaceutical waste management.</p>\n\n<p>The guidance document addresses the severe consequences of improper disposal, including water contamination, potential misuse of expired drugs, and the emergence of adverse drug reactions. Its primary objective is to provide clear instructions for the safe disposal of expired and unused drugs, aligning with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules while minimizing environmental impact, especially in relation to antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</p>\n\n<p>The document outlines several disposal methods, including landfill in engineered sites, waste immobilization via encapsulation and inertization, and sewer disposal for certain liquid pharmaceuticals. It discourages open burning and recommends medium to high-temperature incineration for specific waste types, with chemical decomposition as an alternative when incineration is not feasible. Existing regulations for imported drugs, retail/wholesale outlets, and manufacturing waste are referenced, aligning with the Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016.</p>\n\n<p>The guidance document details the procedures for various stakeholders, including retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, hospitals, and government agencies, emphasizing the return of expired/unused drugs to manufacturers or proper disposal according to the outlined guidelines. It also specifies requirements for maintaining detailed records for regulatory verification and the handling and transportation of expired/unused drugs, including cytotoxic, radioactive, and controlled substances, using yellow non-chlorinated plastic bags or containers.</p>\n\n<p>For the general public, the document suggests establishing \"Drug take back\" sites and provides guidance on medicines that can be flushed down the sink or toilet to prevent accidental ingestion and misuse, aiming to minimize risks to people and pets. Adherence to these guidelines is essential for all stakeholders to protect human health and the environment by significantly reducing the environmental impact and public health risks associated with improper disposal practices.</p>",

These amendments aim to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and fairness of the corporate insolvency resolution process, aligning with the goals of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC).</p>\n\n<p>Key changes include the insertion of a new sub-regulation allowing the committee of creditors to invite interim finance providers as observers to meetings, fostering better financial management. Furthermore, resolution professionals, with committee approval, can now solicit expressions of interest for resolution plans covering the entire corporate debtor or individual assets, broadening potential solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Additional amendments focus on creditor equity and regulatory clarity. A new provision ensures financial creditors who did not support the resolution plan receive proportional and prioritized payments. Revisions to Regulation 39 enhance compliance by explicitly including non-compliant plans in the review process, reinforcing adherence to the IBC and its regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the Fourth Amendment Regulations represent a significant effort by the IBBI to refine the insolvency resolution framework. By increasing flexibility, ensuring fair treatment of creditors, and clarifying regulatory language, these amendments aim to benefit all stakeholders, including corporate debtors, creditors, and the overall economy through a more robust and transparent insolvency resolution process.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In <b>State of Rajasthan v. Balchand alias Baliay (1977)</b>, the Supreme Court of India, led by Justice <b>V.R. Krishna Iyer</b>, affirmed the principle that <b>bail is the rule and jail is the exception</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The accused, <b>Balchand alias Baliay</b>, was convicted of housebreaking and theft under <b>Sections 457</b> and <b>380</b> of the <b>Indian Penal Code</b>. During his appeal against the conviction, he was granted interim bail, which the <b>State of Rajasthan</b> challenged on the grounds that a conviction extinguishes the presumption of innocence.</p>\n\n<p>The Court considered whether a conviction automatically deprives an accused of the right to bail pending appeal, and how to balance <b>societal security</b> with an individual\u2019s <b>fundamental liberty</b>. The prosecution contended that conviction nullifies the presumption of innocence and mandates bail cancellation, while the defense argued that the appeal process is an extension of the trial and preserves the accused\u2019s right to liberty until final judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Krishna Iyer\u2019s judgment emphasized that the <b>presumption of innocence</b> endures until all appellate remedies are exhausted. He underscored that under <b>Article 21</b> of the Constitution, personal liberty must be deprived only through a process that is just, fair, and reasonable. The Court held that \u201c<b>bail is the rule</b>\u201d and that bail may be denied only in exceptional circumstances such as flight risk, tampering with evidence, or threat to public order. It ruled that bail cannot be revoked automatically upon conviction, but must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, ensuring the justice system protects both liberty and public interest.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling established the foundation of modern <b>bail jurisprudence</b> in India, affirming that even a convicted person retains dignity and the right to judicial review. It has guided subsequent judgments to resist mechanical denials of bail and reinforced that restrictions on liberty must be grounded in substantial reasons.</p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, the decision balances <b>personal freedom</b> and <b>public safety</b>, favoring release unless compelling reasons demand custody. As Justice Krishna Iyer eloquently stated: \u201c<b>Bail is the rule and jail is the exception.</b>\u201d</p>",

When Sylvia\u2019s extramarital affair with Prem Ahuja, a wealthy businessman, came to light, Nanavati confronted them. In an emotionally charged encounter, he took his service revolver and went to Prem Ahuja\u2019s residence, where he fatally shot him.</p>\n\n<p>Key legal questions arose: whether Nanavati\u2019s act amounted to murder under <b>Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)</b>, and whether it could be reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <b>Exception 1 to Section 300 IPC</b> for grave and sudden provocation.</p>\n\n<p>At the Bombay Sessions Court, a jury trial returned a \u201cNot Guilty\u201d verdict by 8:1.

    "title": "Cheque Bounce Recovery in India: Your Legal Options Explained",
    "description": "<p>In India, a <b>cheque bounce</b>, technically known as <b>dishonor of cheque</b>, is a criminal offense punishable under Section 138 of the <b>Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881</b>. This happens when a bank refuses to honor a cheque due to insufficient funds in the drawer's account, or for other reasons like signature mismatch. For an ordinary citizen, receiving a bounced cheque can be a frustrating experience, but it's crucial to understand the legal options available to recover the owed amount.</p>\n\n<p>The process for <b>cheque bounce recovery</b> begins with sending a legal notice to the issuer of the cheque. This notice must be sent within 30 days from the date the bank informs you about the dishonor of the cheque. The notice should demand payment of the cheque amount within 15 days. If the issuer fails to make the payment within this period, you have the right to file a criminal complaint in the court of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, within one month from the date of expiry of the 15-day notice period. This initiates legal proceedings under Section 138 of the <b>Negotiable Instruments Act</b>.</p>\n\n<p>A critical aspect of the <b>Section 138</b> case is establishing that the debt or liability exists. The onus is on the complainant to prove that the cheque was issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or other liability. The drawer of the cheque has the opportunity to defend themselves, and the court will consider both sides before delivering a judgment. If the court finds the accused guilty, they can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the criminal proceedings under Section 138, it's also possible to initiate a civil suit for recovery of money. While the criminal case aims to penalize the defaulter, a civil suit aims to recover the outstanding amount along with interest and other costs. Filing a civil suit doesn't preclude initiating criminal proceedings, and both can proceed simultaneously. The legal recourse available to an individual who receives a <b>bounced cheque</b> provides substantial protection, ensuring that financial transactions are honored and that remedies are available when defaults occur.</p>",

    "title": "Indian Landlord Rights: Eviction Rules You Need to Know",
    "description": "<p>In India, landlords have specific rights when it comes to evicting a tenant, governed primarily by the respective state's <b>Rent Control Act</b>. These Acts vary across states, but generally, a landlord cannot evict a tenant at will. A valid and legal ground for eviction must exist, such as non-payment of rent, causing nuisance, subletting without permission, or using the property for illegal activities. It's crucial for landlords to understand the specific provisions of the Rent Control Act applicable in their state to ensure any eviction process complies with the law.</p>\n\n<p>The process of eviction typically involves serving a legal notice to the tenant, clearly stating the reason for eviction and giving them a reasonable timeframe to vacate the premises. If the tenant fails to comply, the landlord can then file an eviction suit in the appropriate court. The court will then hear both sides of the argument, examining the evidence presented by both the landlord and the tenant. The burden of proof usually lies with the landlord to demonstrate that a valid ground for eviction exists under the relevant <b>Rent Control Act</b>. Landlords must keep accurate records of rent payments, communication with the tenant, and any violations of the rental agreement to support their case.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that even with a valid reason for eviction, a landlord cannot use force or illegal means to evict a tenant. Such actions can result in legal repercussions for the landlord, including penalties and damages. The eviction process must be carried out through the court, obtaining a court order for eviction if necessary. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of following due process of law in eviction matters. For example, the landmark case of *Raghunath G. Panhale (Dead) By Lrs. v. M/S. Chaganlal Sundarji And Co* highlighted the need for strict adherence to procedural laws in eviction proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>For ordinary citizens who are landlords, understanding these <b>eviction rules</b> is crucial for protecting their property rights while also acting within the bounds of the law. Seeking legal advice from a lawyer specializing in property law is highly recommended before initiating any eviction proceedings. This ensures compliance with the state's specific Rent Control Act and minimizes the risk of legal complications. Moreover, familiarizing oneself with relevant case laws can provide a better understanding of how courts interpret and apply these laws in practice. Remember that a fair and legal eviction process protects both the landlord's rights and the tenant's rights, promoting a more equitable rental relationship.</p>",

    "title": "Online Fraud Refund: Your Rights Under Indian Law",
    "description": "<p>If you've fallen victim to <b>online fraud</b> in India, knowing your rights concerning a <b>refund</b> is crucial. Indian law provides avenues for recovering lost funds, though the process can sometimes be complex. The primary legislation governing such issues is the <b>Information Technology Act, 2000</b>, which addresses cybercrimes and provides a framework for holding fraudsters accountable. Banks and payment service providers also have a responsibility to ensure secure transactions, and their negligence can lead to liability.</p>\n\n<p>The liability of banks in cases of <b>unauthorized electronic transactions</b> is often governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. These guidelines typically differentiate liability based on customer reporting timelines. If the customer reports the fraudulent transaction promptly (usually within 3 days), the liability is often limited or even zero. Delay in reporting can increase the customer's potential liability. Banks are required to have a robust dispute resolution mechanism to handle customer complaints regarding fraudulent transactions and provide a refund, if warranted. It is important to document all communications with the bank and file a formal complaint with evidence of the <b>fraudulent transaction</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond banking regulations, Section 43 of the <b>IT Act</b> deals with compensation for damages caused to computer systems and networks due to unauthorized access or disruption. While it may not directly guarantee a <b>refund</b>, it allows for claiming damages. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the <b>online fraud</b>, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) provisions related to cheating, forgery, and criminal breach of trust can also be invoked. Registering a First Information Report (FIR) with the police is a crucial step in initiating a criminal investigation and strengthens your case for seeking legal remedies.</p>\n\n<p>For ordinary citizens, the practical implication is to be vigilant and proactive. Immediately report any <b>online fraud</b> to your bank and the cybercrime cell. Keep records of all transactions and communication. File a police complaint to initiate formal investigation. Familiarizing yourself with RBI guidelines on limiting liability in fraudulent transactions can greatly help navigate the process of claiming a <b>refund</b>. Remember, acting quickly and diligently is essential to maximizing your chances of recovering your funds.</p>",

    "title": "Live-in Relationships in India: Know Your Legal Rights",
    "description": "<p>In India, a <b>live-in relationship</b> refers to an arrangement where two individuals choose to cohabit and share their lives together without being legally married. This form of relationship has gained increasing social acceptance, and the Indian legal system has gradually recognized certain rights and protections for couples in such arrangements. However, it's crucial to understand that live-in relationships don't automatically grant the same rights as a marriage. Proof of a relationship resembling marriage, including factors like duration, shared household, pooling of resources, and intent to marry, is often essential for claiming legal entitlements.</p>\n\n<p>Several landmark court judgments have shaped the legal landscape surrounding live-in relationships. The Supreme Court, in cases like D. Patchaiammal v. D. Velusamy, has laid down guidelines for determining the validity and nature of a live-in relationship. To be considered a valid relationship warranting legal protection, the couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses. Importantly, not all cohabitation qualifies as a live-in relationship entitled to legal rights. The court has emphasized the necessity of a long-standing and genuine relationship similar to marriage. These judicial pronouncements primarily aim to prevent exploitation and protect vulnerable partners within such arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>The legal implications for women in <b>live-in relationships</b> are particularly significant. While not explicitly covered under the Hindu Marriage Act, certain legislations like the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provide some recourse. This Act recognizes women in live-in relationships as being in a relationship \"in the nature of marriage,\" thereby entitling them to protection from domestic violence, including physical, emotional, and economic abuse. They can seek remedies such as residence orders, monetary relief, and protection orders under this Act. Further, children born out of live-in relationships are considered legitimate and have inheritance rights in their parents\u2019 property, as established by various court decisions.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that establishing legal rights within a <b>live-in relationship</b> can often be challenging. Unlike a formal marriage certificate, there's no single document that automatically proves the existence of the relationship or its nature. Individuals need to gather evidence, such as joint bank accounts, utility bills with both names, photographs, and testimonies of friends and family, to demonstrate the validity and characteristics of their relationship to the court. Seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer is highly recommended for individuals in live-in relationships to understand their rights and obligations and to navigate the legal complexities effectively. This is especially crucial in cases involving property disputes, maintenance claims, or inheritance matters.</p>",
