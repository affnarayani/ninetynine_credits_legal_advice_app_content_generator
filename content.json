    "title": "Supreme Court Clarifies Arbitrator\u2019s Power to Award Pendente Lite Interest in ONGC v. G&T Beckfield Drilling",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court's decision in *Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. v. G&T Beckfield Drilling Services Pvt. Ltd.* clarifies the scope of an arbitral tribunal's power to award pendente lite interest. The Court held that a general contractual clause prohibiting interest on delayed or disputed payments does not automatically preclude an arbitral tribunal from awarding interest during the pendency of arbitration proceedings. This ruling balances contractual freedom with the need for equitable compensation in commercial disputes.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a contractual dispute between ONGC and G&T Beckfield Drilling Services Pvt. Ltd. regarding unpaid invoices. The arbitral tribunal awarded G&T Beckfield Drilling interest from the date of claim filing. ONGC challenged the award, arguing that Clause 18.1 of the contract expressly forbade such interest. The Supreme Court dismissed ONGC's appeal, asserting that Clause 18.1 only restricted interest on delayed payments during the contract's operational phase and did not restrict the tribunal's discretion to award pendente lite interest.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized the distinction between clauses specifically prohibiting interest \"in any respect whatsoever\" versus those merely barring interest on delayed invoices. The judgment reinforces that arbitral discretion to grant interest is preserved unless expressly excluded by the contract. This decision promotes commercial certainty by requiring precise contract drafting to exclude pendente lite interest, and it ensures fairness by preventing unjust enrichment resulting from prolonged payment delays. This pronouncement serves as a key guideline for arbitral tribunals, courts, and contracting parties.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Karnataka government has enacted the Greater Bengaluru Governance (Registration of Electors) Rules, 2025, to establish a comprehensive system for creating and maintaining accurate voter rolls for Bengaluru's city-corporation wards. These rules address the long-standing issue of using outdated assembly constituency voter lists for civic elections.</p>\n\n<p>The rules outline the definitions and terminology used, aligning with the Greater Bengaluru Governance Act of 2024 and the Representation of the People Act, 1950. Instead of creating rolls from scratch, the commission can adopt the current legislative-assembly roll, while pruning, adding or transposing entries. The roll is frozen once the last date for filing nominations is notified, preventing manipulation.</p>\n\n<p>The process involves enumerators collecting data from residents using Form-2, and the Registration Officer having access to birth, death, and school records to prevent fraudulent registrations. A draft roll is then published for public review, and citizens can submit claims, objections, or corrections using specific forms (Forms 4-8). These forms can be submitted in person, by post, or through an online portal.</p>\n\n<p>Designated officers process applications, and the Registration Officer reviews them, potentially holding hearings to resolve disputes. Supplementary lists for omissions and deletion lists for deceased or moved individuals can be created, subject to objections and hearings. The final roll, with amendment lists, is published, and two free copies are provided to recognized national and state parties.</p>\n\n<p>Aggrieved electors can appeal decisions to an officer designated by the State Election Commission within fifteen days. Rolls are revised annually through either intensive or summary revisions. Outside of the revision cycle, electors can seek corrections or inclusions at any time. The Commission can also order photo-identity cards to reduce impersonation.</p>\n\n<p>Post-election, rolls and related documents are preserved for a specified period. The Commission has the option to adopt the current legislative-assembly roll, ward-bounded and cleansed, for city-corporation elections. Officers involved in the process are considered on deputation to the State Election Commission and are subject to disciplinary action for breaches of duty. The rules aim to translate the promise of universal adult franchise into a tangible process, empowering residents and shaping local democracy in Bengaluru.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Allahabad High Court has affirmed the authority of Pollution Control Boards to levy environmental compensation, reinforcing the \"Polluter Pays\" principle. The ruling in M/s Ramesh Dyeing and Washing, Ghaziabad v. State of U.P. & Ors. upheld the U.P. Pollution Control Board's power to issue closure orders and impose financial penalties for environmental damage.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when the U.P. Pollution Control Board ordered the closure of the petitioner's industrial unit and imposed a fine of \u20b914,20,000. The petitioner challenged the Board's authority, arguing that only the National Green Tribunal (NGT) could impose such a fine. The court rejected this argument, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Delhi Pollution Control Committee v. Lodhi Property Company Ltd., which confirmed that Pollution Control Boards possess the power to impose compensatory damages under Section 33A of the Water Act, 1974, and Section 31A of the Air Act, 1981.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court clarified that these powers are incidental to the Boards' statutory mandate and are remedial, not punitive, in nature. While acknowledging its jurisdiction under Article 226, the court declined to exercise it due to the petitioner's failure to exhaust the appeal process under the NGT Act and an unexplained delay in filing the petition. The judgment solidifies the regulatory power of Pollution Control Boards and emphasizes the importance of industries internalizing environmental accountability.</p>",

Ltd., a corporate debtor undergoing insolvency proceedings. The appeal, filed by the company's suspended director, Deborshi Sadhan Bose, challenged the NCLT's decision to initiate liquidation after the 330-day Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) period expired without an approved resolution plan.</p>\n\n<p>The appellant argued before the NCLAT that a higher settlement offer of \u20b98 crore had been received after the Committee of Creditors (CoC) decided to pursue liquidation. However, the NCLAT noted that the offer was made well after the CIRP period had concluded and the CoC had already resolved to liquidate the company.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT distinguished this case from previous instances where higher offers from resolution applicants during the CIRP period or settlement proposals under Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) were considered. Ultimately, the NCLAT found no grounds to interfere with the NCLT's decision, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the timelines prescribed under the IBC. The appeal was subsequently dismissed, upholding the liquidation order.</p>",

The circular clarifies that resident Indian contributions to GS-FPIs must be made exclusively under the RBI\u2019s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) with restricted Indian securities exposure. Furthermore, GS-FPIs are relieved from filing \"no-change\" declarations and reporting non-material changes during renewal, with only the payment of fees required, while material changes must still be reported. Custodian KYC review cycles are aligned with RBI guidelines for FPI bank accounts, enhancing operational efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>The circular also establishes a clear process for new applicants to register as GS-FPIs and for existing FPIs to transition to GS-FPI status by divesting non-government securities. Conversely, GS-FPIs opting to operate as regular FPIs must fulfill all additional disclosure requirements. Issued under Section 11(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992, and linked to the RBI's FAR, the circular reflects a strategic move towards risk-based compliance, aiming to increase foreign demand for Indian debt and reinforce regulatory alignment.</p>",

This action reinforces compliance with Section 3 of the Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016.</p>\n\n<p>The new guidelines stipulate that penalties for violating Section 3 will be the highest amount calculated from three options: a fixed amount per plot/flat based on jurisdiction (ranging from \u20b93,000 to \u20b915,000), a percentage of the proportionate project cost (2% for plots, 1% for flats), or 2% of the total sale value of unregistered properties as reflected in the Encumbrance Certificate (EC).</p>\n\n<p>Additional penalties are applied for projects with multiple violations. A 50% increase is added to the calculated penalty if 10 to 50 properties are sold illegally, and a 100% increase applies if more than 50 such properties are sold.</p>\n\n<p>This revised penalty framework underscores TNRERA's commitment to protecting homebuyers and fostering a more transparent real estate market.

    "description": "<p>The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Chennai, in Pradeep Jeyavelu v. Income Tax Officer, ruled that a minor's share of inherited property, deposited under court direction, cannot be clubbed with the guardian's income for capital gains tax purposes. This decision balances the Income Tax Act, 1961, with the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956, safeguarding minors\u2019 rights and preventing undue tax burdens on guardians.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved the sale of property inherited by the assessee and his minor daughter. The court approved the sale, stipulating that the minor's share be deposited in a nationalized bank under judicial custody. While the assessee paid taxes on his share of the capital gains, the Assessing Officer sought to club the minor's share with his income. The ITAT ruled against this, stating that since the assessee had no control over the minor's share, the clubbing provisions of Section 64(1A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, did not apply.</p>\n\n<p>The Tribunal emphasized that taxability hinges on ownership and control of income, not merely the occurrence of a transfer. It also accepted the assessee\u2019s claim for brokerage expenses as a customary cost. The ruling clarifies that clubbing provisions are inapplicable when a guardian lacks control over a minor's assets protected by court orders. This provides practical relief for taxpayers in succession cases involving minors, ensuring fair tax administration and the protection of vulnerable stakeholders.</p>",

These rights are rooted in the right to privacy, with the right of publicity recognized as a proprietary right that allows celebrities to control and monetize their persona. The right to privacy, constitutionally backed by Article 21, protects individuals from unwanted exposure and misrepresentation, which has been reinforced in digital safety rulings such as the Madras High Court\u2019s 2025 judgment in X v. Union of India.</p>\n\n<p>Legal safeguards include the Copyright Act, 1957 (moral rights for performers), the Trademarks Act, 1999 (protection of names and catchphrases), and the common law tort of \"passing off,\" which prevents misleading endorsements. The judiciary grants injunctions to prevent unfair exploitation, and intermediary liability under the IT Act, 2000 and the IT Rules, 2021 mandates expedited notice-and-takedown mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Recent Delhi High Court interim orders, particularly in Aishwarya Rai Bachchan v. Aishwaryaworld.com & Ors. and Abhishek Bachchan v. The Bollywood Tee Shop & Ors., address challenges from AI and deepfake technology. These cases involved unauthorized use of the Bachchans' personas, including the sale of merchandise, fake websites, and AI-generated content. The court issued injunctions requiring platforms to remove infringing content, emphasizing the financial and reputational harm caused by unauthorized use.</p>\n\n<p>These rulings reaffirm the judiciary's commitment to protecting individual dignity against technological threats. They signify a shift where personality rights are viewed as integral to dignity, privacy, and autonomy, not just economic entitlements.

The Court affirmed that a validly executed and probated Will dictates the devolution of property, precluding the State's intervention based on escheat claims.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from the estate of Raja Bahadur Sardar Singh, who created the Khetri Trust via a Will and Codicil prior to his death in 1987. While the initial probate petition was dismissed, the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court later overturned this decision, upholding the Will's validity. The State of Rajasthan appealed, asserting its right to the property based on the claim that the testator died without heirs.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court dismissed the State's challenge, emphasizing that the State lacks the standing to contest a validly executed Will. The ruling underscores the significance of adhering to the testator\u2019s intent and reinforces the limits of governmental intervention in succession matters. The Court's decision reaffirms the principle that escheat is a remedy of last resort, applicable only in the absence of both a Will and legal heirs.

This right stems from the fundamental freedoms of speech and expression, as well as the right to life and personal liberty, encompassing dignity and individuality. The court emphasized that any curtailment of this right must meet the test of reasonableness under Article 19(2), allowing restrictions only in cases involving fraud, criminality, or overriding public interest.</p>\n\n<p>In the Mohd. Hassan case, the petitioner, originally named Raj Wali, sought to change his name to Mohd. Hassan. The Jammu & Kashmir Board of School Education rejected his application to update his educational certificates, citing a limitation period and lack of provision for such changes. The High Court overturned this decision, clarifying that the limitation period applied only to corrections of errors, not substantive name changes. The court emphasized that constitutional rights prevail over administrative rules, and that public documents reflecting the changed name hold statutory presumption of correctness under the Indian Evidence Act.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment aligns with a broader judicial consensus among Indian High Courts, including Allahabad, Kerala, and Delhi, which recognize the right to change one's name as a constitutionally guaranteed entitlement under Articles 19(1)(a) and 21. This jurisprudence highlights that a name is central to individuality. The decision in Mohd.

The ruling emphasizes that these claims cannot be easily dismissed. Concurrently, it underscores the limited scope of judicial review, which is restricted to correcting evident errors and not a disguised appeal.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a partition suit filed in 2000, excluding Malleeswari. After a series of property transfers and her father's death, Malleeswari sought amendment of the preliminary decree in 2018 to reflect her coparcenary rights based on the 1989 and 2005 amendments. The Trial Court dismissed her application, but the High Court initially recognized her rights before reversing its decision on review.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court addressed two key issues: the enforceability of Malleeswari's coparcenary rights despite the 2003 decree and whether the High Court exceeded its review jurisdiction. The Court held that the High Court improperly expanded the scope of review by re-evaluating settled facts. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, reinstating the High Court's original order which recognized Malleeswari's one-third coparcenary share and directed the Trial Court to expedite pending applications.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment is significant as it reinforces the statutory rights of daughters and defines the boundaries of appellate and review jurisdiction.

Its key objectives include simplifying the law, providing certainty on digital assets and cross-border transactions, ensuring equity for middle-income taxpayers through revised slabs, and modernizing administration with technology-driven processes.</p>\n\n<p>Structurally, the Act replaces the \"Previous Year\" and \"Assessment Year\" system with a single \"Tax Year\" definition. It streamlines provisions, removes archaic clauses, and simplifies drafting while maintaining legal rigor. Transitional arrangements are in place to ensure continuity for pending assessments and preservation of accumulated entitlements.</p>\n\n<p>For individuals, the new regime is the default, offering complete relief up to \u20b94,00,000 income, with a more generous rebate under Section 87A, potentially resulting in no liability for taxpayers up to \u20b912,00,000. For corporations, existing competitive tax rates are maintained, and Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) rules are clarified. International taxation aligns with OECD's BEPS standards, with the equalisation levy retained and strengthened reporting obligations for non-residents.</p>\n\n<p>Significantly, the Act formally recognizes Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs), bringing cryptocurrencies and NFTs into the statutory framework.

State of Telangana, quashed three FIRs against a citizen who criticized the ruling Congress Party and the Chief Minister on \"X\" (formerly Twitter). The Court ruled the FIRs were inappropriately filed and further issued binding guidelines for police and magistrates on handling complaints related to social media speech.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioner was accused of posting tweets that included abusive language, compared the Congress party to a pest, and alleged corruption in the Chief Minister\u2019s government. The FIRs cited offences under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The prosecution argued the tweets defamed the Chief Minister and disturbed public tranquility, while the petitioner contended they were protected political commentary under Article 19(1)(a) and did not constitute cognizable offenses.</p>\n\n<p>Justice N. Tukaramji concluded that the FIRs were mechanically registered without meeting statutory requirements. The court emphasized that political criticism, even if harsh, does not automatically constitute provocation, public mischief, or obscenity. At most, some posts might be considered under defamation, but such cases require a complaint by the aggrieved party before a magistrate, not a police investigation. The Court then established clear guidelines for police and magistrates in Telangana on handling social media speech cases, emphasizing preliminary inquiry, high thresholds for speech-related offenses, and locus standi.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment is considered a significant moment for free speech jurisprudence in India. It interprets the BNS and BNSS in the context of digital expression and reinforces that political speech, even when uncomfortable, should not be suppressed through criminal law. By offering operational clarity to law enforcement and judicial officers, the ruling aims to protect citizens, journalists, and opposition voices from arbitrary FIRs and politically motivated harassment. It reaffirms the constitutional principle that democracy thrives on dissent, criticism, and debate, and that freedom of speech is a fundamental right requiring diligent protection, particularly in the digital age.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court Clarifies Strict Application of Limitation in Negotiable Instruments Act Cases",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India has reaffirmed the importance of adhering to statutory timelines in cheque dishonor cases under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (NI Act). The ruling emphasizes that a complaint filed after the prescribed deadline cannot be automatically considered maintainable. Any delay necessitates a formal application for condonation, which must be substantively evaluated by the court.</p>\n\n<p>Section 138 of the NI Act provides recourse for payees when cheques are dishonored due to insufficient funds, but Section 142(b) requires the complaint to be filed in writing and within a specific timeframe. While courts can condone delays, this is not an automatic process. The Supreme Court clarified that the principle of certainty in limitation law is paramount, particularly in quasi-criminal cheque dishonor proceedings. Statutory timelines prevent abuse and ensure fair, prompt prosecution.</p>\n\n<p>In H.S. Oberoi Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. M/s MSN Woodtech, the Court overturned decisions by lower courts that had proceeded with a cheque dishonor complaint filed five days late without a formal condonation application. The Supreme Court underscored that even minor delays require a proper application under Section 142(b). While the civil recovery proceedings were unaffected, the Court emphasized that criminal liability under the NI Act requires strict adherence to limitation requirements.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling reinforces that limitation is a crucial statutory mandate. While courts retain the discretion to condone delays under Section 142(b), this power is conditional upon a formal application supported by valid reasons. This preserves the balance between protecting the rights of payees and shielding accused individuals from prosecutions initiated outside statutory timelines.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has announced the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Third Amendment) Regulations, 2025, effective September 8, 2025. These amendments to the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (\u201cLODR Regulations\u201d), are part of SEBI's ongoing initiative to improve transparency, bolster investor protection, and increase accountability within the securities market. The focus is particularly on corporate actions and the Social Stock Exchange framework.</p>\n\n<p>The LODR Regulations, 2015, serve as a comprehensive set of guidelines for listing and disclosure obligations for listed entities. SEBI has the authority to regulate companies' access to the securities market and ensure their compliance through Sections 11, 11A(2), and 30 of the SEBI Act, 1992, in conjunction with Section 31 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. The current amendment, following earlier ones in March and May 2025, demonstrates SEBI's commitment to fortifying the dematerialization system and the Social Stock Exchange framework, which was initially established in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Third Amendment Regulations, 2025, substantially reinforce the compliance framework under the LODR Regulations. Listed entities must rigorously comply with the dematerialization mandate. Simultaneously, NPOs and social enterprises on Social Stock Exchanges must adapt their disclosure practices, impact assessment methodologies, and fundraising strategies. For all market participants, these amendments emphasize SEBI's dedication to investor protection, transparency, and accountability.</p>",

    "title": "Balancing Disclosure Requirements and Unintentional Errors in Passport Applications",
    "description": "<p>The Punjab and Haryana High Court recently addressed the complexities surrounding passport revocation in the case of Navpreet Kaur v. Union of India & Ors., emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach by passport authorities when dealing with potential errors in applications. The case involved a petitioner, Navpreet Kaur, whose passport was revoked for allegedly suppressing material information regarding her marital status.</p>\n\n<p>The Regional Passport Office (RPO) revoked Kaur's passport after she applied to change her spouse's name, citing that she had previously mentioned her former husband's name on prior applications despite their divorce. The High Court analyzed whether mentioning a previous spouse's name constituted suppression of material information under the Passports Act, 1967, and whether revocation was justified.</p>\n\n<p>The court ruled that the suppression or misinformation must be material, meaning it would have led to the passport's refusal under Section 5(2)(c) of the Act if disclosed correctly. Drawing on precedent, the court determined that inadvertent mistakes regarding marital status do not warrant revocation under Section 10(3)(b). The court found Kaur's explanation plausible\u2014that the error was an oversight during renewal\u2014and emphasized that incorrect disclosure without intent to misuse does not trigger penal provisions. The court allowed Kaur's petition, nullified the revocation, and instructed authorities to issue a new passport with accurate details. This judgment serves as a reminder that passport authorities must exercise caution and consider the nuances of each case before resorting to revocation.</p>",

    "title": "No Receipts, No Problem: Supreme Court Clarifies Enforceability of Cash in Promissory Notes",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court has addressed a common problem in recovery suits involving cash components in financial transactions, particularly when receipts are absent. The core issue revolves around whether courts should enforce the full amount acknowledged in a written instrument, like a promissory note, even if a portion was paid in cash without independent proof, or discount the cash element.</p>\n\n<p>The court case Georgekutty Chacko v. M.N. Saji served as the backdrop. The Kerala High Court had previously reduced the decreed amount of a promissory note, only accepting bank transfers and rejecting the cash component. The Supreme Court overturned this decision, emphasizing that a promissory note acts as sufficient acknowledgment of the entire debt. The absence of cash receipts does not invalidate the claim. Once liability is acknowledged in writing, the burden shifts to the borrower to disprove it, reinforcing the evidentiary weight of such instruments.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling underscores that while courts acknowledge the challenges in tracing cash payments, they recognize them as a legitimate part of financial dealings. The court seeks to balance protecting lenders from unfair denial of debt and ensuring borrowers are not burdened by unsubstantiated claims. This approach preserves confidence in financial dealings by upholding the reliability of promissory notes while allowing for valid defenses.</p>",

    "title": "Family Property Dispute Settled: Supreme Court Clarifies What Truly Constitutes Ownership",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India has reiterated that property ownership requires a registered sale deed and cannot be validly claimed through documents like Agreements to Sell, General Power of Attorney (GPA), or affidavits. In Ramesh Chand (D) Thr. LRs. v. Suresh Chand & Anr., the Court emphasized the necessity of strict proof for Wills, particularly when surrounded by suspicious circumstances. This ruling reverses the prior decisions of the Trial Court and High Court, establishing a cautionary precedent for family property disputes where informal transfers and unproven documentation are prevalent.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a dispute between two brothers, Suresh Chand and Ramesh Chand, over property previously owned by their deceased father, Kundan Lal. Suresh claimed sole ownership based on a 1996 Agreement to Sell, GPA, affidavit, receipt, and registered Will. Ramesh contested these documents, asserting that the property had been orally gifted to him in 1973.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court determined that the property remained with Kundan Lal until his death and, given the failure to properly prove the Will, would devolve upon all Class-I legal heirs under succession law. The Court clarified that Ramesh Chand's sale of a portion of the property would only be valid to the extent of his rightful share, safeguarding the purchaser's interests without infringing on the rights of other heirs. Consequently, the prior judgments were overturned, the plaintiff's suit was dismissed, and the parties were directed to resolve their respective rights through succession law.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling underscores the critical importance of complying with statutory requirements for property transfers. By emphasizing the need for formal, registered instruments, the Court aims to promote transparency in property dealings and prevent disputes arising from informal transfers. While potentially affecting litigants who relied on less formal documentation, the decision ultimately reinforces the rule of law and aims to reduce manipulation in succession disputes.</p>",

    "description": "<p>On September 1, 2025, India's Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) implemented the Immigration and Foreigners Rules, 2025, under the new Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025. This Act and its Rules consolidate and modernize India\u2019s immigration laws, creating a comprehensive framework governing the entry, stay, movement, and exit of foreign nationals, as well as outlining the responsibilities of carriers and immigration authorities.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, India's immigration framework was a fragmented system of statutes and executive orders, including the Foreigners Act, 1946. The new Act and Rules aim to address duplication, ambiguities, and compliance challenges by establishing a single, comprehensive code. The Bureau of Immigration (BoI) is formally designated as the nodal body for implementing and enforcing the Act, standardizing procedures and documentation nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>Key changes include enhanced responsibilities for airlines, shipping companies, and other carriers. They are now required to provide Advance Passenger Information (API), Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, and a General Declaration prior to departure, subject to verification by an Immigration Officer. Non-compliance can result in significant penalties. The system also incorporates technology-driven measures, such as biometric verification, digitized records, and centralized databases, to improve border security and streamline passenger processing.</p>\n\n<p>The new Rules impact foreign nationals, carriers, employers, and legal practitioners. Foreign nationals must maintain valid travel documents to avoid penalties or deportation. Carriers must upgrade their systems to comply with mandatory data-sharing requirements. Employers must reassess their immigration compliance protocols, and legal practitioners can anticipate increased disputes related to immigration enforcement. Overall, the Immigration and Foreigners Rules, 2025 represent a fundamental shift in how immigration law is administered in India, emphasizing secure, transparent, and efficient management through centralized authority, mandated carrier compliance, and technology-driven oversight.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dismissed an appeal alleging bid-rigging in the liquidation auction of M/s Atlas Alloy (India) Private Limited. The case, Jai Agarwal v. Satyendra Prasad Khorania & Ors., centered on accusations of collusion and technical sabotage after the appellant, Jai Agarwal, lost the auction for a Beawar plot by a narrow margin.</p>\n\n<p>The auction, conducted on the government-mandated portal, saw Novelty Textiles emerge as the highest bidder. Agarwal alleged that Novelty was a \"straw man\" bidder inserted at the last minute, and further claimed bribery, confidentiality breaches, and technical obstruction. The NCLT Jaipur Bench initially dismissed Agarwal's plea, prompting the appeal to the NCLAT.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT scrutinized Agarwal's claims against the portal's audit logs, bank statements, and time-stamped entries. The tribunal found no evidence to support the allegations of collusion, bribery, or technical manipulation. It emphasized that while Regulation 33 of the IBBI (Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2016, mandates transparency and value maximization, accusations of fraud must be distinctly alleged and strictly proven. The NCLAT upheld the NCLT's order, emphasizing that the e-auction was fair, transparent, and compliant with the law. The case serves as a reminder that suspicion and screenshots are insufficient substitutes for hard data in insolvency proceedings, and highlights the importance of fair participation and documented transparency in e-auctions.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in M/s Motilal Agarwala v. State of West Bengal, addressed the crucial question of when the 90-day limitation period under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, commences for government entities. The court reaffirmed that the limitation period begins only when a signed copy of the arbitral award reaches the officer competent to decide on challenging the award, not merely upon receipt by any government official.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a 2013 arbitral award in favor of M/s Motilal Agarwala. Although an Assistant Engineer received a copy of the award shortly after it was issued, the State of West Bengal claimed they only became aware of it much later during execution proceedings. The State then filed a Section 34 application to challenge the award, which was initially dismissed by the District Court as time-barred. The Calcutta High Court reversed this decision, holding that service on an unauthorized officer did not trigger the limitation period.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's judgment, emphasizing that for large government organizations, the award must reach the individual with knowledge of the proceedings and the authority to decide whether to challenge it. The Court noted that delivery of the award is not a mere formality and that diluting the \"competent authority\" rule would create uncertainty in government litigation. Consequently, the Supreme Court dismissed the contractor's appeal and directed the District Court to decide the Section 34 application on its merits. The ruling clarifies that limitation starts only when the competent departmental head receives a signed copy, aiming to balance the strictness of limitation with the realities of bureaucratic structure.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Glencore International AG vs. Shree Ganesh Metals & Anr, has ruled that the absence of a signature on an arbitration clause does not automatically invalidate it. The Court emphasized that the key factor is the demonstrable intention of the parties to submit disputes to arbitration, which can be evidenced through written communication, conduct, or other documentation. This decision reinforces the principle of party autonomy in arbitration, prioritizing substance over form and aligning India with global arbitration standards.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a commercial dispute where one party challenged the validity of an arbitration agreement due to the lack of formal signatures. While previous contracts between Glencore and Shree Ganesh Metals were signed, the contract in question was confirmed via email exchanges but not physically signed. The Supreme Court clarified that Section 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, requires an arbitration agreement to be \"in writing\" but does not mandate signatures for validity. The Court emphasized that the intention to arbitrate is the crucial element.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling has significant implications for India's arbitration regime. It provides reassurance to businesses and investors by clarifying that the clear intention of the parties to arbitrate, rather than the presence of a signature, is paramount. This decision diminishes the potential for technical objections based solely on missing signatures, enhancing certainty and reliability in commercial transactions. It reinforces confidence in arbitration as an efficient and business-friendly dispute resolution mechanism, solidifying India's pro-arbitration stance.</p>",

Ltd. addressed the validity of a Power of Attorney (POA) executed by officers nominated by designation rather than by name. The case arose from the dismissal by the NCLT of Indian Bank's application to amend particulars of debt, due to concerns over the validity of the POA held by the Chief Manager filing the application.</p>\n\n<p>Indian Bank argued that its Board of Directors had established a Uniform Power of Attorney System, authorizing General Managers or a General Manager along with a Deputy/Assistant General Manager nominated by the CMD or Executive Director, to execute POAs on behalf of the Bank. The bank emphasized that delegation by designation is legally valid. Aman Hospitality contended that only individual nominations by name were sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT ruled in favor of Indian Bank, setting aside the NCLT's order. The Tribunal found that the Board resolution allowed for officer nomination, and designations provided sufficient certainty regarding authorized incumbents. Drawing from the Supreme Court's judgment in United Bank of India v. Naresh Kumar, the NCLAT cautioned against hyper-technical objections that could impede substantive justice. The matter was remanded back to the NCLT for reconsideration on its merits.

The ruling in Sameer Pareek vs. Shweta Pareek (MAT.APP.

The Family Court ruled in her favor, a decision Sameer Pareek appealed.</p>\n\n<p>Before the High Court, Sameer Pareek argued he disclosed his prior marriage orally, the petition was filed late, and his parents created the profile.

State of Maharashtra addresses the complex issue of slum redevelopment in Mumbai, specifically concerning the acquisition of slum-encroached land under the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971. The central question was whether landowners have a preferential right to redevelop slum-affected land before the State or Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) can intervene.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved land owned by Indian Cork Mills Pvt. Ltd. (ICM), a portion of which was declared a slum area. While the Tarabai Nagar Cooperative Housing Society (representing slum dwellers) sought land acquisition for redevelopment, ICM asserted its right to redevelop the land independently. The State of Maharashtra issued an acquisition notification, prompting ICM to challenge the decision in the Bombay High Court, which ruled in favor of the landowner, granting them the initial opportunity to propose a redevelopment scheme.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court upheld the Bombay High Court's decision, affirming that landowners possess a primary and preferential right to redevelop land designated as a Slum Rehabilitation Area. The SRA is obligated to notify the landowner, inviting them to submit a redevelopment proposal before the State can proceed with acquisition. This ruling ensures procedural fairness, safeguards property rights, and necessitates that the government provide landowners a fair opportunity to redevelop before resorting to compulsory acquisition. However, the court also acknowledged the rights of slum dwellers to initiate redevelopment if landowners fail to act within a reasonable timeframe. This decision clarifies the roles of landowners and the SRA, impacting future slum rehabilitation projects in Maharashtra by promoting transparency, reducing disputes, and ensuring a balance between private property rights and social welfare.</p>",
