    "title": "High Court Clarifies Locus Standi for Section 138 NI Act Complaints",
    "description": "<p>The Himachal Pradesh High Court's decision in *Shirgul Filling Station v. Kamal Sharma* emphasizes the strict procedural requirements for cheque dishonor cases under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The court upheld the dismissal of a complaint filed by a sole proprietorship due to a failure to adequately prove the proprietorship and the legal standing of the person initiating the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>The Trial Court found that the complainant, Shirgul Filling Station, failed to provide conclusive proof that Shivani Gupta was the proprietor. The authority letter provided by Ankur Aggarwal was deemed invalid as it was issued after the legal notice was sent and the complaint filed, and was not a valid power of attorney. Furthermore, as the cheque was issued to Shirgul Filling Station, and Ankur Aggarwal failed to prove the proprietorship, he could not be considered the \"payee\" as required by Section 138.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed the Trial Court's decision, dismissing the criminal appeal and upholding the acquittal of Kamal Sharma. The judgment underscores the importance of adhering to procedural requirements, establishing clear locus standi with valid authorization, and ensuring authorization timeliness. This ruling serves as a reminder for litigants, especially those representing sole proprietorships, to ensure proper legal representation and meticulous observation of procedural formalities before initiating action under Section 138 of the NI Act. Failure to do so can result in dismissal, regardless of the underlying financial dispute.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court, in a ruling on July 15, 2025, quashed an FIR registered under Sections 69 and 351(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, highlighting the misuse of criminal proceedings in disputes arising from a live-in relationship. The case involved Anil Verma, the petitioner, and Respondent No. 2, who had been in a 15-year relationship and cohabitating since 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The initial FIR, filed by the Respondent No. 2 due to misunderstandings, led to allegations of criminal offences. However, the parties subsequently reached an amicable settlement, with the complainant admitting the complaint was filed during a period of emotional distress and no longer wished to pursue the matter. Despite the State's opposition, arguing against setting a compromising precedent in cases involving alleged sexual exploitation, the Court recognized the complainant's autonomy and the personal nature of the dispute.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma emphasized that forcing a trial after reconciliation would be counterproductive. However, acknowledging the severity of initiating criminal proceedings based on misunderstandings, the Court imposed a cost of \u20b920,000 on the complainant, payable to the Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee, to discourage the casual use of criminal law. Consequently, FIR No. 154/2025 and all related proceedings were quashed. The Court cautioned against using criminal law as a tool for emotional leverage in personal relationships, particularly given the severe legal and reputational consequences.</p>",

    "title": "Overpricing Beyond MRP Violates Consumer Law: Thrissur Forum Orders Refund and Compensation",
    "description": "<p>The Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Thrissur has reaffirmed the significance of the Legal Metrology Act and consumer rights, ruling that charging even a single rupee over the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) on pre-packaged goods constitutes an unlawful and unfair trade practice. This decision reinforces the protection afforded by the Consumer Protection Act, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the MRP displayed on product packaging.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when a consumer, Lenish V.R., was charged Rs. 800 for a brandy bottle with an MRP of Rs. 740 at a Kerala State Beverages Corporation (KSBC) outlet. Despite KSBC acknowledging the overcharge, they failed to provide evidence justifying the additional amount. The Commission found that the consumer successfully demonstrated the violation, shifting the burden of proof to KSBC, which they could not fulfill.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission emphasized that as per the Legal Metrology Act, 2009, and the Packaged Commodities Rules, 2011, retailers are prohibited from selling pre-packaged commodities above the MRP, except in cases of valid tax revisions within a specific timeframe, which KSBC could not prove. The Commission also noted that, as a government-owned entity, KSBC has a responsibility to act as a model vendor, upholding consumer rights and statutory norms without exception.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission directed KSBC to refund the excess amount of Rs. 60, provide Rs. 5,000 in compensation for mental distress, and cover Rs. 10,000 in litigation costs, all with interest. Additionally, KSBC was instructed to immediately cease the practice of overcharging for pre-packaged commodities. This ruling serves as a clear warning to retailers, particularly government-owned establishments, regarding the sanctity of MRP and empowers consumers to actively protect their rights against unfair trade practices.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Government of Kerala has issued an order, effective from July 14, 2025, granting a two-year exemption from stamp duty and registration fees for beneficiaries of the Life Mission housing scheme acquiring land for residential purposes. This initiative, aimed at enhancing housing affordability for economically weaker sections, aligns with the state's commitment to social welfare and housing rights.</p>\n\n<p>The exemption is enabled by the Kerala Stamp Act, 1959, and the Registration Act, 1908, which empower the State Government to remit or reduce stamp duty and registration fees in the public interest. The Life Mission scheme, Kerala\u2019s flagship housing program, aims to provide secure housing to landless and homeless families through financial assistance and infrastructure support.</p>\n\n<p>To avail of the exemption, beneficiaries must present a certificate from the District Collector or authorised Tehsildar confirming their status as a Life Mission beneficiary and the land's exclusive use for constructing a residential dwelling under the scheme. This exemption reduces the financial burden on beneficiaries, potentially saving them 8-10% of the transaction value, while requiring compliance with procedural requirements. Developers and NGOs involved in Life Mission projects should also factor this exemption into their processes, while the state foregoes revenue in favor of long-term social infrastructure development.</p>\n\n<p>This exemption represents a strategic regulatory intervention supporting inclusive housing by removing cost barriers for vulnerable households and reinforcing the State's focus on welfare-centric governance. Legal and compliance professionals should integrate this exemption into relevant transactions, ensuring timely compliance with certification requirements and transaction timelines.</p>",

The Act mandates registration for all coaching institutes operating in Assam and establishes comprehensive standards for academic quality, operational practices, safety, and ethical conduct.

    "description": "<p>In *Vibhor Garg v. Neha*, the Supreme Court of India ruled that secretly recorded telephonic conversations between spouses are admissible as evidence in matrimonial proceedings like divorce, clarifying a key point of law in the digital age. The Court held that spousal privilege under Section 122 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, does not bar such recordings when the dispute is between the spouses themselves.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a husband seeking to introduce audio recordings as evidence of cruelty in divorce proceedings. The Supreme Court overturned a High Court decision that had disallowed the evidence based on privacy concerns, affirming the Family Court's initial decision to admit the recordings. The Court clarified that Section 122 contains an exception for suits between spouses, and the right to privacy under Article 21, while fundamental, is not absolute and must be balanced against the right to a fair trial.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court reaffirmed the existing test for admitting secretly recorded conversations, emphasizing that lack of consent alone does not render evidence inadmissible. Further, electronic records, including audio recordings, are admissible under Sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, provided the necessary certification is submitted. While not issuing binding procedural safeguards, the Court acknowledged the need for caution and suggested factors for Family Courts to consider when evaluating such evidence, including proportionality, intent, and evidentiary safeguards. The ruling balances the right to privacy with the imperatives of justice, allowing relevant evidence to be considered while acknowledging the potential for misuse.</p>",

The ruling supports Mohan Meaking Ltd., the manufacturer of the globally recognized \"Old Monk\" coffee-flavored rum, finding a prima facie case of infringement.</p>\n\n<p>Mohan Meaking Ltd. initiated the suit against Eston Roman Brewery, alleging that the defendant's \"Old Mist\" product closely resembled their registered trademark, \"Old Monk Coffee.\" The plaintiff's trademark is valid until 2031, while the defendant possesses no such registration. The plaintiff argued that the visual and conceptual similarity between the products could mislead consumers, potentially damaging the plaintiff's brand reputation as the third-largest rum manufacturer globally.</p>\n\n<p>After examining the products, labels, and trademark certificates, the Court determined that Mohan Meaking Ltd. had established a strong case for trademark infringement. The Court expressed concern that the defendant's continued sales would result in unfair advantage, passing off, and irreparable harm to the plaintiff's established goodwill. Consequently, the Court granted the interim injunction, preventing the defendant from selling or distributing the infringing product until further notice, emphasizing the importance of protecting established trademarks within the liquor industry.</p>",

Natubhai Golanbhai Khuman & Ors.*, upheld the acquittal of the accused in a dowry death case, emphasizing the necessity of strong evidence for convictions under Sections 304B, 306, 498A, and 114 of the IPC. The case involved a woman who allegedly committed suicide after her in-laws demanded money for legal expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The prosecution argued that the in-laws harassed the woman to procure \u20b950,000 from her father for bail in an unrelated land forgery case, leading her to take her own life. Initially, the FIR was registered under Sections 306 and 498A IPC, and later Section 304B was added, but the trial court acquitted the accused due to lack of evidence.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court affirmed the acquittal, clarifying that not every post-marital demand qualifies as \"dowry\" under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. The court reasoned that the demand for bail money was a post-marital financial dispute, not a dowry demand made \"in connection with the marriage.\" However, the court also cautioned that while the demand didn't constitute dowry, the conduct could still amount to \"cruelty\" under Section 498A or abetment to suicide under Section 306, provided sufficient evidence exists. The court's decision was based on unproven medical causes of death, a lack of credible evidence of financial harassment, and accused having sufficient funds that contradicted the prosecution's narrative.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment underscores the importance of prosecutors carefully framing charges, gathering reliable evidence, and distinguishing between dowry-linked demands and other forms of oppressive conduct. While the decision is legally sound regarding Section 304B, it should not diminish the seriousness of non-dowry related cruelty, which remains actionable under other IPC provisions.</p>",

This decision, formalized through an order issued on July 7, 2025, by the Revenue and Forests Department, builds upon a previous order from June 20, 2023, which had already reduced stamp duty by 50% for properties within Development and Regional Plans approved for Integrated Township Projects.</p>\n\n<p>The full remission specifically applies to the development of Growth Centers within the MMR by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), executed through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), M/s. Raigad Pen Growth Centre Ltd. This concession, deemed necessary in the public interest, covers the remaining 50% of the stamp duty for the initial conveyance related to 1217.71 acres of land parcels explicitly identified in the joint venture agreement and approved under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966. The conditions outlined in the June 20, 2023, order remain applicable.</p>\n\n<p>This complete stamp duty remission provides a significant financial incentive for large-scale integrated township projects by eliminating a substantial transaction cost. It is anticipated to accelerate development, attract greater investment in urban infrastructure, and contribute to meeting the growing demand for well-planned residential, commercial, and recreational spaces in the MMR.

The case, *G Nagarathna & Ors. vs. G Manjunatha & Anr.*, stems from a fatal accident where the driver's excessive speed and traffic violations led to his death. His family's claim for compensation was rejected by both the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal and the High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court, in dismissing the family's appeal, affirmed the established tort law principle that individuals cannot benefit from their own wrongdoing. The Court reasoned that a borrower of a vehicle assumes the responsibilities and risks of ownership, including the duty to drive safely. Awarding compensation in such cases would contradict fundamental tort principles and public policy.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling clarifies that while the legal heirs of a negligent driver cannot claim compensation for the driver\u2019s death, valid claims made by third parties injured due to the deceased\u2019s negligence remain actionable under the Motor Vehicles Act. The decision discourages reckless driving and safeguards the integrity of the insurance system by preventing individuals from profiting from their own negligent acts.

The case involves Saif Ali Khan, his mother Sharmila Tagore, and sisters Soha and Saba Ali Khan, who were previously recognized as the lawful heirs. This decision emphasizes the primacy of personal succession laws over customary or royal succession norms, potentially setting a precedent for similar princely inheritance disputes.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute centers on the estate of Nawab Mohammad Hamidullah Khan, the last ruling Nawab of Bhopal.  While Sajida Sultan was initially recognized as the legal successor, other heirs filed partition suits in 1999, arguing for distribution under Muslim Personal Law. The High Court's ruling highlighted that the original trial court's decision was flawed because it relied on a precedent overturned by the Supreme Court in 2019, which affirmed that personal law governs inheritance, even for former royal families. The case has been remanded for a fresh trial, with all parties permitted to present new evidence.</p>\n\n<p>A crucial legal dimension involves the Enemy Property Act 1968, potentially impacting claims derived through Abida Sultan, who acquired Pakistani citizenship. This act could lead to the forfeiture of her share, vesting it in the Custodian of Enemy Property. The High Court's decision mandates the Pataudi family to reassert their claim under Muslim Personal Law, subject to judicial scrutiny and potential reallocation. This ruling is likely to influence other royal inheritance disputes across India, reinforcing that post-accession private properties are governed by statutory personal laws, not royal customs. The case highlights the judiciary's commitment to modern legal standards over historical privileges, potentially reshaping the legal framework surrounding former royal estates and reconciling tradition with constitutional modernity.</p>",

The decision in *Aakash Deep Chouhan v. CBI & Anr.* clarifies the circumstances under which wiretapping is justified under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from an FIR against the accused for allegedly conspiring to bribe a public servant to secure a sub-contract. The CBI relied on intercepted calls between the accused, leading the petitioner to challenge the legality of the interceptions, arguing they violated his right to privacy and did not meet the requirements of the Indian Telegraph Act. The CBI countered that corruption impacts national economic safety, satisfying the public safety threshold, and that the interceptions were duly authorized and reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Amit Mahajan dismissed the plea, stating that corruption involving public servants has far-reaching consequences on economic well-being and can qualify as a threat to public safety. The court found the interception orders specified \"public safety\" as the ground and met the conditions under Section 5(2) of the Act. The ruling contrasts with a recent decision by the Madras High Court, which quashed a phone-tapping order in a corruption case, emphasizing the need for a clear public emergency or evident risk to public safety.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment reaffirms the balance between privacy rights and the need to investigate corruption that undermines public institutions and economic security. It suggests that courts may interpret \u201cpublic safety\u201d broadly in cases of significant economic offenses, serving as a caution to companies and executives that conversations related to economic crimes may be grounds for surveillance if statutory procedures are followed.

In *Sujal Mangala Birwadkar v.

He claimed to have experienced deprivation and humiliation linked to his mother's community. However, the court found no evidence to support these claims, noting that the petitioner had good educational opportunities and his mother was financially independent. Additionally, school records initially identified him as Hindu Agri.</p>\n\n<p>The court reiterated that a mere biological connection to a backward community is insufficient. Claimants must demonstrate systemic social disadvantage linked to that community status to claim reservation benefits.

    "title": "India's PM E-DRIVE Scheme: Incentives for Electric Trucks",
    "description": "<p>The Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) has announced specific guidelines for electric trucks (e-trucks) under the PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) Scheme, aiming to promote sustainable transport and domestic manufacturing. Effective July 10, 2025, the notification (S.O. 3081(E)) details eligibility, demand incentives, phased manufacturing requirements, and compliance conditions for N2 and N3 category e-trucks, supplementing the broader PM E-DRIVE Scheme. Incentives for articulated vehicles in the N3 category will apply exclusively to the \u201cpuller tractor.\"</p>\n\n<p>Incentives will be calculated based on the lowest of the set parameters. A key prerequisite for availing incentives is mandatory vehicle scrappage, requiring manufacturers to submit a Certificate of Deposit from an authorized Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facility (RVSF) for an equivalent or higher GVW ICE truck. Eligible e-trucks must meet stringent performance and efficiency criteria, including electric regenerative braking systems and compliance with AIS 039 and CMVR norms. A minimum warranty is also mandated.</p>\n\n<p>The scheme emphasizes progressive domestic manufacturing via a Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) and its verification. With a total outlay of \u20b9500 crore, the scheme aims to support 5,643 e-trucks in FY 2025\u201326, subject to a maximum ex-factory price cap of \u20b91.25 crore per vehicle.</p>\n\n<p>The PM E-DRIVE e-truck notification aligns with various legal and policy frameworks, including the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the CGST Act, 2017, and the General Financial Rules (GFR), 2017, building upon the legacy of the FAME India scheme. This initiative signifies a strong push towards decarbonizing India's heavy-duty freight sector, stimulating demand, ensuring environmental compliance, and boosting indigenous EV component manufacturing.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, in *Saravana Prasad v. Endemol India Pvt. Ltd.*, has clarified the liability of One Person Companies (OPCs) and their sole shareholders in arbitration proceedings. The Court set aside an arbitral tribunal's interim order imposing personal deposit and disclosure obligations on Mr. Saravana Prasad, the sole shareholder of Innovative Film Academy Pvt. Ltd. (an OPC), reaffirming the principle of limited liability under Indian corporate law.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from a production agreement between Innovative and Endemol, resulting in \u20b910.40 crores in unpaid invoices. The arbitral tribunal's interim order, under Section 17 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, directed both Innovative and Mr. Prasad to deposit the disputed amount and disclose assets.</p>\n\n<p>The Court ruled that while requiring Innovative to secure the disputed amount was fair, extending this obligation to Mr. Prasad personally was unsustainable. It emphasized that an OPC is a distinct legal entity under Section 2(62) of the Companies Act, 2013, offering limited liability. Being a sole shareholder or director does not equate to personal liability absent contractual liability, fraud, or misuse. Imposing personal obligations on Mr. Prasad undermined the legislative intent behind OPCs.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court partially allowed the appeal, setting aside the personal obligations imposed on Mr. Prasad while upholding the requirements for Innovative. This ruling reaffirms corporate separateness and limited liability, protecting individual entrepreneurs in OPCs from personal financial exposure unless specific legal thresholds are met.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, in *Ritesh Haldar v. Elite Housing LLP*, ruled that redevelopment processes cannot circumvent legal eviction procedures for individuals in lawful possession, even without ownership. The case involved competing claims to a flat undergoing redevelopment, focusing on the intersection of matrimonial rights, property possession, and redevelopment logistics.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute centered on a flat being redeveloped by Elite Housing LLP, where Leena, the wife of one of the owner's brothers, resided with her children, claiming it as her matrimonial home. While she didn't claim ownership, she opposed the redevelopment without compensation and alternate accommodation. Ritesh, claiming ownership, sought to hand over the flat, viewing Leena as a gratuitous licensee.</p>\n\n<p>The court emphasized that redevelopment cannot replace formal eviction processes, reinforcing that Leena's eviction required a court decree. The court cited precedents highlighting that the person in actual possession at the time of redevelopment is entitled to transit rent and restoration of possession in the redeveloped property. While acknowledging Ritesh's ownership, the court directed the Permanent Alternate Accommodation Agreement (PAAA) be executed in his name, and that he receive hardship compensation, but this did not affect Leena\u2019s possessory rights.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Court endorsed a dual-track approach, recognizing Ritesh\u2019s rights as legal owner for purposes of contractual execution and compensation, while protecting Leena\u2019s possessory rights during and after redevelopment. Leena will receive transit rent and possession of the redeveloped flat, subject to the outcome of an existing eviction suit. The ruling underscores the importance of lawful possession and due legal process in redevelopment projects, balancing ownership rights with possessory protection.</p>",

The court directed the trial court to conclude proceedings within one year. To expedite the process, the Deputy Director of the FSL was ordered to submit the final report within two months.

This policy aligns with the growing trend of balancing equal opportunity with necessary workplace protections.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, Section 66(1)(b) of the Factories Act, 1948, restricted women from working night shifts, but this provision has been challenged as discriminatory. The Haryana notification, issued under No. 11/6/2022-4Lab, supersedes previous notifications and sets forth comprehensive conditions for factories employing women at night.</p>\n\n<p>Key requirements include voluntary written consent from women workers, full compliance with the POSH Act, enhanced workplace safety measures including CCTV surveillance, mandatory transportation, readily available medical assistance, and adherence to all applicable labor laws, including the Factories Act, 1948 and the Equal Remuneration Act. Employers must also report any untoward incident immediately, implement a self-certification mechanism, and be aware that the government may impose additional conditions. The exemption granted is valid for one year.</p>\n\n<p>This notification represents a progressive move, removing outdated restrictions while enhancing employer accountability. It positions Haryana alongside states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, which have similar exemptions, and supports India's expanding manufacturing base by promoting economic participation and gender justice in industrial employment.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Calcutta High Court, in *Super Smelters Limited v. Universal Cables Limited*, addressed the enforceability of an arbitration clause within a purchase order. The court ruled in favor of the arbitration clause and appointed a sole arbitrator under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The central issue was whether an arbitration clause in the purchase order remained binding despite a jurisdiction clause in a subsequent tax invoice.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioner, Super Smelters Ltd., initiated a tender, which led to a purchase order (P119Y-00458) issued to the respondent, Universal Cables Ltd. Disputes arose concerning the functionality of capacitor panels supplied by the respondent, which led to the petitioner terminating the purchase order and demanding a refund. When the respondent disputed this termination and demanded further payment, the petitioner invoked the arbitration clause contained in the initial purchase order.</p>\n\n<p>The court determined that the purchase order was the primary agreement and that the conduct of the parties indicated mutual consent to its terms, including the arbitration clause. The tax invoice, unilaterally issued later by the respondent, was deemed ancillary and could not override the previously agreed-upon arbitration clause. The Court distinguished precedents cited by the respondent, emphasizing that those cases pertained to summary suits and did not concern the prioritization of arbitration clauses in conflicting documents. The court clarified that its role under Section 11 is limited to a prima facie examination of whether a valid arbitration agreement exists and does not entail a detailed trial or analysis of the merits.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Calcutta High Court upheld the validity of the arbitration clause in the purchase order, emphasizing its significance in the contractual agreement. The Court appointed Mr. Amitesh Banerjee, Senior Advocate, as the sole arbitrator, deferring all further objections, including those related to jurisdiction and arbitrability, to the arbitrator for resolution in accordance with the law.</p>",

He highlighted his efforts to reinstate this principle through recent adjudications in high-profile bail cases, including those of Prabir Purkayastha, Manish Sisodia, and K Kavitha, emphasizing the enduring relevance of Justice Krishna Iyer's contributions to bail jurisprudence and prisoners' rights.</p>\n\n<p>The lecture, hosted by the Sarada Krishna Satgamaya Foundation for Law and Justice, underscored Justice Iyer's pioneering work advocating for a progressive, rights-based approach to bail, emphasizing protective yet non-onerous bail conditions and opposing extended pre-trial detention. CJI Gavai lamented the erosion of this approach, noting that courts often defaulted to incarceration. He pointed out that in sensitive cases in 2024, his benches scrutinized the legality of arrests and addressed procedural lapses by investigating agencies.</p>\n\n<p>CJI Gavai's remarks echoed concerns about the misuse of stringent laws like the UAPA and PMLA, where the presumption often shifts towards \"jail is the rule.\" He reiterated Justice Krishna Iyer's philosophy that undertrials should not be indefinitely detained, and bail conditions should not be punitive, especially for the poor. Highlighting Justice Iyer\u2019s humanistic approach, the CJI cited landmark judgments that championed the protection of personal liberty and dignity. The CJI's address serves as a reminder for courts to recenter bail as the norm, even under harsh statutes, and for investigating agencies to uphold procedural safeguards. His address serves as a compelling call for the judiciary to balance security concerns with individual liberty, continuing to illuminate the path toward a humane and rights-respecting legal system.</p>",

The case hinged on the interpretation of debt and the existence of pre-existing disputes under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC).</p>\n\n<p>Mrs. Salot filed a petition under Section 9 of the IBC to initiate the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) against Ridham Synthetics for non-payment of an outstanding operational debt. The NCLT dismissed the petition, prompting Mrs. Salot to appeal to the NCLAT. Mrs. Salot argued that the outstanding amount was admitted by Ridham Synthetics in their ledger statements, through part payments and also contended that the Respondent had availed the benefit of Input Tax Credit under the CGST Act, 2017, indicating their acknowledgment of the invoices.</p>\n\n<p>Ridham Synthetics claimed that the invoices were for goods not delivered or of inferior quality. They cited a WhatsApp message as evidence of a pre-existing dispute regarding the quality of goods.

This decision strengthens the rights of transferees pendente lite.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from a suit for specific performance where the defendant sold the property to P. Marimuthu during the suit's pendency. The trial court dismissed Marimuthu's impleading petition, arguing the suit was reserved for judgment. Marimuthu appealed, contending he was a bona fide purchaser entitled to be heard, while the plaintiff argued that the impleading application was belated and Marimuthu was bound by lis pendens.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court held that transfers pendente lite are subservient to the rights of parties in litigation under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. However, relying on Supreme Court precedent, the court emphasized that transferees pendente lite have a significant interest in defending their title and should generally be allowed to participate, especially when the original party may not properly contest the suit. The Court explicitly rejected the notion that impleading petitions are inadmissible once a matter is reserved for judgment, stating that \"at any stage of the proceedings\" in Order I Rule 10(2) CPC means any time before judgment pronouncement. The Court allowed the appeal and directed the trial court to accept the impleading application, permit cross-examination of the plaintiff, and allow formal evidence regarding the sale deed.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment reinforces the principle that procedural technicalities should not defeat substantial rights, particularly when collusion or prejudice to a transferee exists. It reminds transferees pendente lite that while lis pendens limits their rights, it does not extinguish them. Trial courts are reminded to exercise their power to implead parties under Order I Rule 10(2) CPC sensitively, even at advanced stages of proceedings. Ultimately, *P. Marimuthu v. S.S. Prabhakaran* reaffirms the judiciary's commitment to protecting bona fide purchasers and upholding justice by allowing impleading petitions before judgment, balancing the sanctity of litigation with preventing procedural injustice.</p>",

The ruling explicitly states that such objections are valid even when raised by the appointing party itself. Section 4 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which deals with waiver by conduct, does not apply in cases governed by Section 12(5).</p>\n\n<p>The decision underscores the judiciary's duty under Section 34(2)(b) to set aside awards violating India's public policy, including principles of equality and impartial adjudication. It serves as a caution against unilateral arbitrator appointments, particularly by government entities, without explicit written waivers after a dispute arises and urges a review of standard arbitration clauses to ensure compliance with statutory requirements.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Madras High Court, in a judgment on June 2, 2025, validated the State Bank of India's (SBI) Clause 1(E), which disqualifies candidates with adverse credit histories from employment, even if debts have been repaid. The ruling stemmed from the case of *P. Karthikeyan v. General Manager and ors.*, where SBI cancelled the appointment of a candidate selected for the post of Circle Based Officer (CBO) due to a poor CIBIL report.</p>\n\n<p>Karthikeyan, despite clearing all stages of the selection process, had his appointment revoked after SBI discovered multiple loan defaults, written-off loans, and overdue credit card dues in his CIBIL report. He argued that he had cleared all debts and was not declared a defaulter, claiming the cancellation was discriminatory. SBI countered that the recruitment notification explicitly cautioned candidates about eligibility criteria, including Clause 1(E), and that Karthikeyan's adverse credit history revealed significant financial indiscipline.</p>\n\n<p>Justice N. Mala upheld SBI's decision, emphasizing that Clause 1(E) clearly disqualifies candidates with adverse credit histories, regardless of subsequent repayment. The court cited Karthikeyan's CIBIL report, which showed multiple loan defaults, lender litigation, delayed credit card payments, and numerous credit inquiries. The ruling reinforces the importance of maintaining a clean credit history for individuals seeking employment in the financial sector, highlighting that financial credibility is a professional necessity and that employers are entitled to set high financial standards for their employees.</p>",

Union of India & Ors.*, has clarified that arbitral awards passed by the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council (MSEFC) can only be challenged under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The ruling addresses jurisdictional conflicts arising from the intersection of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (MSMED Act), and general arbitration law.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a dispute between Odisha Mining Corporation Ltd. (OMC) and M/s Indiana Engineering Works, a Maharashtra-based small enterprise, regarding a 1994 contract. After disputes arose, Indiana Engineering approached the Thane MSEFC, which ultimately issued an ex parte award in 2015. OMC challenged the award through a writ petition, arguing lack of jurisdiction, breach of natural justice, and procedural impropriety.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court rejected OMC's arguments, reinforcing that Section 34 of the Arbitration Act is the sole remedy for challenging MSME arbitral awards, citing the Supreme Court's decision in *M/s Silpi Industries v. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation*. The court further held that the Thane MSEFC had jurisdiction because Section 18(4) of the MSMED Act grants jurisdiction to the MSEFC where the supplier (Indiana Engineering) is located. The court also stated that Section 32(2) of the MSMED Act validated the proceedings even though the claim was originally filed under the repealed Interest on Delayed Payments Act, 1993.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment has significant implications for MSME suppliers and buyers. It reinforces the MSMED Act's status as a special legal regime, strengthens the predictability of MSME arbitration proceedings, and emphasizes the importance of procedural rigor before MSEFCs, as post-award challenges are now narrowly confined to Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.</p>",

This decision reinforces the autonomy of corporate entities in voluntary liquidation and distinguishes it from compulsory liquidation following Corporate Insolvency Resolution Processes (CIRP).</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from the voluntary liquidation of Transmissions International India Private Limited (TIIPL), where the initial liquidator, Mr. Umesh Ved, was replaced by Mr. Chandra Prakash Jain, who was then removed by shareholder resolution and replaced by Mr. Arun Gupta. Mr. Jain challenged his removal before the NCLT, which directed a status quo, effectively preventing the replacement.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT emphasized that voluntary liquidation under Section 59 of the IBC is a self-contained regime where liquidator appointments and replacements are governed by shareholder decisions, not requiring NCLT approval, as clarified by Regulation 5 of the IBBI (Voluntary Liquidation Process) Regulations, 2017. The Tribunal deemed the NCLT's status quo order as exceeding its jurisdiction. The NCLAT also addressed the NCLT's decision to de-reserve its judgment citing procedural irregularities, deeming it arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT's ruling affirms that directors and shareholders possess full authority to appoint or replace liquidators during voluntary liquidation, absent evidence of fraud or misconduct, and that adjudicating authorities cannot interfere with decisions made in accordance with Section 59 of the IBC and associated regulations. The judgment underscores the importance of timely completion of voluntary liquidation and minimizes the potential for procedural delays and judicial overreach. This provides clarity to stakeholders, emphasizing that voluntary liquidation is a shareholder-driven process with minimal regulatory interference required.</p>",

The judgment underscores the importance of Section 64-VB of the Insurance Act, 1938, emphasizing that premium payment is a prerequisite for an insurance contract to become effective.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a fatal accident where the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT) initially directed HDFC ERGO to pay compensation. The insurer appealed, arguing that although a cover note was prepared, it was immediately canceled due to non-receipt of the premium, and the policy was never delivered. The High Court upheld the insurer's argument, finding that no valid insurance contract existed at the time of the accident.</p>\n\n<p>The court distinguished this case from instances where policies are issued but subsequently canceled, referencing the Supreme Court's view that insurers might remain liable to third parties in such scenarios if a cancellation notice wasn't issued before the accident. However, since the cover note was canceled at inception and retained by the insurer, there was no need for a cancellation notice. This decision aligns with a broader judicial consensus requiring both premium payment and policy issuance for an enforceable insurance contract. The ruling shifts the liability back to the registered vehicle owner, reinforcing contractual discipline within the insurance sector and preventing unwarranted claims.</p>",

The ruling balances the need to protect business interests with the employee's right to pursue better opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose after Tyagi, an IT Engineer formerly employed by Daffodil Software on the POSHAN Tracker project, accepted a General Manager position at Digital India Corporation (DIC) upon leaving Daffodil. Daffodil sought an injunction, alleging Tyagi's new role violated a non-solicitation and non-compete clause and risked disclosing proprietary information. The trial court initially granted an ex parte ad interim injunction, restricting Tyagi's employment with DIC.</p>\n\n<p>Tyagi appealed, arguing the clause was void under Section 27, which prohibits agreements restraining trade. He contended the project's intellectual property belonged to DIC, not Daffodil. Daffodil countered that Tyagi's role at DIC would utilize confidential information acquired during his employment and that the clause was reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>The Delhi High Court, led by Justice Tejas Karia, ruled the non-compete clause void as it extended beyond Tyagi's employment. It determined that the claim of proprietary information disclosure was unfounded, as DIC owned the POSHAN Tracker's intellectual property. The court noted that preventing Tyagi's employment with DIC would cause irreparable harm to his career and financial stability. Consequently, the appeal was granted, and the injunction was quashed.

The court addressed whether a transwoman could lodge a complaint under Section 498-A IPC and whether the proceedings against the petitioners should be quashed. The court observed the constitutional right to self-identify gender under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 and the provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. It dismissed the argument that biological reproduction is essential for legal recognition as a woman. The Court recognized the validity of the marriage under Hindu customs and held the transwoman is fully entitled to seek protection under matrimonial laws.</p>\n\n<p>While affirming the right of transwomen to seek protection under Section 498-A IPC, the court also cautioned against the misuse of the provision.

While the writ court initially ruled in favor of the employee, arguing the personal dispute shouldn't affect his employment, the appellants contended that the employee's conduct violated the professional standards expected of public servants under the Conduct Rules, which permit disciplinary action for misconduct even outside the workplace. The respondent maintained the allegations were unrelated to his professional role and his performance was satisfactory.</p>\n\n<p>The division bench overturned the writ court's decision, emphasizing that public servants are expected to uphold integrity in both professional and personal lives, and misconduct under the Conduct Rules extends beyond workplace behavior to actions that could tarnish public service. The court acknowledged the respondent's contractual term had expired, making reinstatement untenable, and stressed judicial intervention in contractual employment matters should be cautious. The final decision affirmed the government's authority to initiate disciplinary measures for conduct violations, whether professional or personal, underscoring the judiciary's role in respecting administrative autonomy while ensuring fairness. This case serves as a precedent for interpreting misconduct and contractual obligations in public administration.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, in the case of NAGAR vs State of Maharashtra, addressed the conflict between urban development and environmental conservation in Mumbai. The case challenged the Maharashtra Government's policy allowing the use of public recreational spaces for slum rehabilitation, highlighting the need to balance housing with the preservation of open spaces.</p>\n\n<p>The legal challenge stemmed from a government notification and amendments to the Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) 2034, which permitted converting open spaces into housing zones. NAGAR argued this contravened the city's Development Plan and undermined urban health by diminishing vital recreational areas. The petition invoked constitutional principles, the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 (MRTP Act), the Doctrine of Public Trust, Sustainable Development, and the Precautionary Principle.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court acknowledged Mumbai's housing shortage but emphasized the importance of public open spaces for well-being. It struck down the contentious provisions of Regulation 17(3)(D)(2), deeming them inconsistent with urban planning principles and constitutional mandates, and directed the State to revise housing policies to align with the MRTP Act. The judgment serves as a precedent for balancing urban development and environmental conservation, reaffirming the importance of preserving public spaces and integrating inclusivity with sustainability.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) has reaffirmed the definition of a \"consumer\" under the Consumer Protection Act, particularly in real estate transactions, in the case of *Mrs. Rajni Suryakant Gujar v. Shree Vinayaka Developers*. The case involved a dispute over a property transaction where the appellants, engaged in real estate brokerage, sought to purchase a plot but were denied the sale deed despite making payments.</p>\n\n<p>The NCDRC upheld the dismissal of the consumer complaint, citing the Supreme Court's precedent that purchases for commercial purposes do not qualify the purchaser as a \"consumer.\" The commission found that the appellants' transaction was part of their regular commercial activity, thus excluding them from consumer status under both the 1986 and 2019 Consumer Protection Acts.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the NCDRC addressed the issue of transacting with an individual partner of the developer firm, noting that the partnership deed required transactions to be conducted in the firm's name. Given allegations of fraud and the complex nature of the dispute, the Commission directed the appellants to pursue remedies in civil or criminal courts, as consumer forums are not suited for adjudicating such matters. This decision underscores the importance of evaluating the complainant's consumer status and the capacity in which parties contract, ensuring consumer forums focus on protecting genuine consumers rather than commercial operators or investors.</p>",

The regulations define key terms, including \"Act,\" \"adjudicating officer,\" \"appellant,\" and \"appellate authority,\" to ensure clarity and uniformity in their application.</p>\n\n<p>The regulations outline procedures for filing complaints, which can be submitted electronically, via speed post, or in person using Form-I. Upon receiving a complaint, the adjudicating officer issues a notice (Form-II) to the respondent, specifying the alleged contravention and requiring a response within a specified period. The officer then decides whether to proceed with an inquiry, providing the respondent an opportunity to present evidence (Form-III). The officer can enforce attendance of individuals relevant to the case and may proceed in absentia if the respondent fails to appear. Penalties are imposed via written order specifying reasons and the contravened provision of the Act.</p>\n\n<p>An appeal process is also detailed, allowing aggrieved parties to file an appeal (Form-IV) to the appellate authority within 45 days. The appeal must include a copy of the adjudicating officer's order, a statement of facts, and grounds for the appeal.

Taking Suo-motu cognizance of the matter, the court reaffirmed the constitutional obligation to safeguard the environment and issued detailed directions for strict enforcement of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, effective from October 2, 2025. This intervention addresses the increasing plastic pollution in high-footfall tourist destinations despite existing state bans.</p>\n\n<p>The Court identified major hill stations as plastic pollution hotspots due to high tourist footfall. It imposed a complete ban on specific SUPs in these areas, exempting only larger plastic water and soft drink bottles. The ban extends to official events and private gatherings, covering items like plastic plates, cups, and straws. The court has instructed that licenses for establishments should now incorporate these restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>To facilitate the transition, the court prescribed viable eco-friendly alternatives and directed the establishment of clean water kiosks and refill stations. Local authorities are tasked with regular clean-up drives of rivers, canals, and backwaters, and must collaborate with voluntary organizations. Additionally, the court emphasized the enforcement of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) obligations, mandating producers, importers, and brand owners to manage post-consumer plastic waste effectively. The Chief Secretary and the Principal Secretary of the Local Self Government Department were directed to lead the implementation.</p>\n\n<p>The ruling strengthens the legal and constitutional framework for environmental protection in India, drawing upon constitutional provisions, environmental statutes, and delegated legislation.

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India has reaffirmed that a registered instrument is mandatory for the transfer of immovable property. In *Mahnoor Fatima Imran & Ors. v. State of Telangana & Ors.*, the Court ruled that an unregistered agreement to sell, even if validated later, does not confer legal title. The decision arose from a dispute over land in Telangana, emphasizing that mere possession, if not lawfully established, cannot justify protection from dispossession under Article 226 of the Constitution.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved 53 acres of land originally part of a larger tract declared surplus under the Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms (Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings) Act, 1973. A cooperative society claimed to have purchased the land via an unregistered agreement in 1982, later \"validated\" in 2006. Subsequently, the society executed registered sale deeds to individuals who sought protection from dispossession, claiming unlawful takeover by the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC).</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court underscored the importance of the Registration Act, 1908, mandating registration for any document transferring rights in immovable property. The unregistered 1982 agreement, despite its \"validation,\" remained legally ineffective. The Court also pointed to conflicting versions of the agreement, casting doubt on its authenticity. The Court reiterated that only a registered sale deed confers ownership, referencing Suraj Lamp & Industries Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana. Additionally, the petitioners failed to establish lawful possession and statutory vesting of the land in the State under land reform laws further negated any claim of ownership.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling has significant implications for legal practitioners, real estate stakeholders, buyers, developers, and financial institutions. It emphasizes the need for thorough due diligence, verifying documentation, legal history, and statutory status of land, ensuring every transaction is backed by a properly executed and registered sale deed. The Supreme Court ruling reinforces that registered ownership is the only valid foundation for title to immovable property, safeguarding against claims based on unregistered agreements or mere possession.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Competition Commission of India's (CCI) order in *TT Friendly Super League Association v. Table Tennis Federation of India* establishes a significant precedent for applying competition law to sports governance in India. Delivered in December 2024, the ruling clarifies that the regulatory status and non-profit nature of sports bodies do not exempt them from antitrust scrutiny when they operate as market participants. The case addresses whether a regulator can also act as a competitor, with the CCI firmly stating they cannot.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a complaint by TT Friendly Super League Association (TTFSL), an organization running non-ranking table tennis tournaments, against a WhatsApp advisory issued by the Suburban Table Tennis Association (TSTTA). The advisory warned players against participating in unaffiliated events, threatening suspension from official tournaments. TTFSL alleged anti-competitive conduct under Sections 3 and 4 of the Competition Act, 2002. The CCI investigated the conduct of four associations, identifying relevant markets as the \"market for organizing table tennis events in Maharashtra\" and the \"market for regulating professional table tennis in India.\" All four associations were deemed \u201centerprises\u201d involved in economic activities.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission concluded that the associations abused their dominant positions, violating Sections 4(2)(a)(i), 4(2)(b)(i), and 4(2)(c) of the Competition Act, 2002. The WhatsApp advisory was considered a coercive directive restricting player participation in independent tournaments. Clauses within the Table Tennis Federation of India's Memorandum of Association (MoA) were also found to be overly restrictive and anti-competitive. Furthermore, TSTTA's conduct constituted vertical restraints under Section 3(4) of the Act, causing an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC).</p>\n\n<p>Despite the violations, the CCI refrained from imposing monetary penalties due to remedial measures undertaken by the associations and the fact that it was a first-time offense. Instead, a cease-and-desist order was issued under Section 27, warning of stricter consequences for repeat offenses. The ruling reinforces athletes\u2019 right to compete and signals a shift toward player-centric regulation, requiring federations to adapt to a more open sporting ecosystem. The ruling highlights the need for sports federations to align their practices with fair competition principles and replace restrictive policies with transparent governance frameworks. The verdict also supports market access, innovation, and athlete choice in the evolving landscape of Indian sports.</p>",

The case (Arbitration Application No. 41 of 2023) arose from a joint development MoU and subsequent agreement of sale concerning a 2-acre plot, where disputes emerged over payment obligations and project timelines.</p>\n\n<p>Urbanwoods Realty sought the appointment of an arbitrator under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, while the respondents argued that termination of the MoU and agreement of sale nullified the arbitration clause. The court emphasized the doctrine of separability, affirming that an arbitration clause remains valid even if the main contract is terminated. The court's role under Section 11 is limited to verifying the existence of a prima facie arbitration agreement, without delving into the dispute's merits or contract validity.</p>\n\n<p>The court interpreted the MoU and agreement of sale as a single transaction. Despite the use of \"may\" in the agreement of sale's arbitration clause, the court concluded that the intention to arbitrate was clear when considering both agreements together. Objections regarding insufficient stamping were deemed issues for the arbitral tribunal to decide. The High Court appointed Sri Justice V. V. S. Rao as the sole arbitrator, tasking the tribunal with resolving all issues, including the termination of the underlying agreements. This ruling underscores the importance of well-drafted arbitration clauses and the court's commitment to upholding arbitration as an efficient dispute resolution mechanism.</p>",

State of Kerala & Ors.*, Justice Ziyad Rahman directed the Kozhikode Corporation to issue a birth certificate identifying the couple simply as \"parents,\" instead of \"father\" and \"mother.\" This decision marks a significant step towards inclusive family law in India, offering hope for queer and transgender families.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose after Zahhad, a transgender man, gave birth to a child with Ziya Paval, a transgender woman. Despite their legal recognition as transgender individuals, the child's initial birth certificate designated Zahhad as \"mother\" and Ziya as \"father,\" contradicting their identities. The couple sought the court's intervention to be recognized as \"parents\" to avoid potential psychological, legal, and social consequences for their child.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Rahman grounded his decision in Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution, emphasizing equality, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, and the right to life and dignity.

The central issue was whether IndiaMART's use of the trademark \"PUMA\" as a brand keyword on its B2B marketplace constituted trademark infringement, given that the platform facilitated listings that potentially included counterfeit PUMA goods.</p>\n\n<p>PUMA contended that IndiaMART facilitated the sale of counterfeit goods by allowing sellers to use the \"PUMA\" mark as a keyword, infringing on their registered trademark. IndiaMART argued that it operated as an intermediary under Section 2(1)(w) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, providing a platform for sellers without altering their content, and therefore should not be held liable for third-party listings.</p>\n\n<p>The court overturned the Single Judge's order, stating that offering \"PUMA\" as a brand keyword did not inherently constitute trademark infringement under Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. The court emphasized that IndiaMART provided listing services and was not directly involved in the sales transactions between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, the court affirmed IndiaMART's immunity as an intermediary under Section 79(1) of the IT Act, as it did not originate or modify the content and took down infringing listings upon notification.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment reinforces the principles established in *Shreya Singhal v.

However, the Commission found no specific policy clause excluding rabies or viral infections. They reasoned that the policy's definition of \"injury\" as an accidental bodily injury caused by external, violent, and visible means could encompass a rabies infection resulting from an animal bite. This interpretation aligns with legal precedents, including a Supreme Court ruling that snakebites qualify as accidental deaths under such policies.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission invoked the \"contra proferentem\" rule, stating that ambiguities in insurance contracts must be interpreted in favor of the policyholder. They concluded that IFFCO Tokio's repudiation lacked justification and constituted a deficiency in service under the Consumer Protection Act.

This ruling emerged from a habeas corpus petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, addressing the alleged unlawful detention and coercion of a woman by her family due to her sexual orientation. The court's decision emphasizes personal liberty, autonomy, and an evolving understanding of family, reflecting a progressive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights within the existing legal framework.</p>\n\n<p>The case was initiated by a petitioner seeking the release of her partner, who was allegedly being held against her will and subjected to coercive measures aimed at altering her sexual orientation. This was considered within the context of evolving LGBTQIA+ jurisprudence, particularly landmark judgments like NALSA v. Union of India and Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India, which decriminalized consensual same-sex relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Justices G.R. Swaminathan and Justice V. Lakshminarayan ruled in favor of the petitioner, asserting the detainee's right to make her own life choices. The court reiterated that the concept of family extends beyond traditional definitions to include chosen families, underscoring personal autonomy as a cornerstone of dignity and freedom. The judiciary's role in safeguarding the constitutional rights of marginalized communities, including LGBTQIA+ individuals, was also emphasized.</p>\n\n<p>The court also cited Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, guaranteeing the right to life and personal liberty, and referenced the Yogyakarta Principles advocating for the universal enjoyment of human rights, including the right to form families free from discrimination based on sexual orientation. The court allowed the detainee to leave with the petitioner and ordered the police to ensure the couple's safety and address complaints from the LGBTQIA+ community promptly. This decision marks a significant step in recognizing and protecting the rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals in India, emphasizing the importance of judicial intervention in the absence of legislative recognition for same-sex marriage.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in *Abhishek Singh v. Ajay Kumar & Ors*, addressed the principles governing the quashing of FIRs, emphasizing the importance of prima facie evidence and procedural fairness. The case stemmed from allegations of fraud and misappropriation related to a loan agreement where the appellant, Abhishek Singh, pledged gold ornaments as collateral, which were later deemed counterfeit by the bank without his knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The Patna High Court had quashed Singh's FIR, viewing it as a retaliatory measure lacking prima facie evidence. It further stated the appellant failed to file an affidavit under Section 156(3) CrPC. However, the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, asserting that the quashing of an FIR should be based on the presence of a prima facie case, not an in-depth analysis of evidence at the preliminary stage.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court found that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction by engaging in evidentiary appreciation, a role reserved for the trial court. It noted inconsistencies in the High Court's reasoning, particularly concerning the appellant's intent and the absence of third-party verification during the gold revaluation. The Supreme Court restored the FIR, directing the trial court to proceed with the matter according to the law, and emphasized that its decision was not a reflection of the merit of the allegations. This decision underscores the caution required when quashing an FIR, ensuring thorough examination of allegations presenting a prima facie case through due process.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court Rules: Developer Not Liable for Homebuyer\u2019s Loan Interest Due to Delay in Flat Possession",
    "description": "<p>On June 4, 2025, the Supreme Court of India delivered a judgment in a case involving the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) and homebuyers Anupam Garg and Rajiv Kumar. The case centered on delays and unilateral changes in the 'Purab Premium Apartments' housing project, initiated in 2011. The court examined the legal obligations of developers and the rights of consumers under Indian law.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose after delays in the project's completion beyond the initial possession date of May 21, 2015. Anupam Garg, an allottee, filed a consumer complaint citing a lack of progress and unilateral changes. The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) initially ruled in favor of Garg, directing GMADA to refund the deposited amount with interest, compensation, and the interest paid on Garg's loan.</p>\n\n<p>GMADA appealed to the Supreme Court, contesting its liability for the loan interest. The Supreme Court, referencing precedents like *Bangalore Development Authority v. Syndicate Bank* and *GDA v. Balbir Singh*, ruled that GMADA was not liable for the homebuyers' loan interest. The Court deemed the already awarded 8% interest sufficient compensation for the delay, emphasizing that compensation must be based on specific losses or injuries suffered by the consumer.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision clarifies the extent of a developer's liability in cases of project delays, setting a precedent for future disputes. It reinforces the need for developers to adhere to contractual obligations and provide reasonable compensation for delays, while preventing undue financial burdens. The judgment aims to promote transparency, accountability, and fairness in the housing market, reaffirming the Court's commitment to protecting the interests of all parties involved in consumer disputes.</p>",

    "title": "From Shelf to Scooter: The Legal Mess Behind India\u2019s 10-Minute Commerce Boom",
    "description": "<p>India's burgeoning quick commerce sector, characterized by companies promising deliveries in 10 minutes or less, faces substantial legal and regulatory hurdles. These challenges range from zoning violations due to strategically located \"dark stores\" in residential areas to food safety concerns and questions surrounding the rights and classifications of gig workers as \"independent contractors\". The article also considers the impacts on cost per order, profitability, and service fees on consumer interests.</p>\n\n<p>Regulatory compliance remains a major concern. Quick commerce platforms, often classified as IT companies, navigate grey areas to sidestep stringent retail regulations and labor laws which enable them to engage in predatory pricing practices. This has prompted investigations from the Competition Commission of India (CCI).</p>\n\n<p>The sector also grapples with economic sustainability. High operational costs and initially low average order values (AOV) present profitability challenges. While some platforms have managed to increase their AOV, this often involves offering higher-value product categories, each bringing its own regulatory and compliance complexities. Service fees and packaging costs further impact consumer interest and raise concerns from consumer protection agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer protection is another critical area of focus. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) scrutinizes delivery time claims and addresses issues like differential pricing based on device type. The CCPA is also cracking down on \"dark patterns\" through self-audits required of e-commerce platforms, designed to promote ethical and transparent user interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the gig worker model employed by many quick commerce platforms has been under the scanner. Concerns arise regarding fair working conditions, lack of social security benefits, and pressures leading to unsafe practices. States like Rajasthan and Karnataka are introducing ordinances and acts to protect gig workers' rights and ensure welfare.</p>\n\n<p>Food safety is also a major area of regulatory focus. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has issued comprehensive guidelines and licensing requirements for e-commerce food businesses, addressing concerns over hygiene and standards. Compliance is critical, with penalties for violations.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, compliance with Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodity) Rules, 2011, is crucial to prevent misleading practices in quantity declaration and product labeling. Similarly, data privacy concerns arise from the vast amounts of consumer data collected by these platforms, with the Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, aiming to regulate data collection, usage, and storage.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail e-commerce in India is allowed up to 100% under the automatic route for marketplaces, while inventory-based e-commerce is not permitted, balancing the need for foreign capital with the protection of domestic businesses. Lastly, ensuring quality standards through hallmarking and adherence to BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) is essential for products like jewelry and electronics to protect consumers from substandard goods.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In a significant ruling, the Bombay High Court in *Anirudh Prataprai Nansi v. Union of India* directed the Central Government to fully reimburse \u20b922,08,440 to Mr. Nansi, a retired government employee, for a heart transplant conducted at a private hospital. The court emphasized the primacy of Article 21 of the Constitution, safeguarding the right to life, in cases where essential medical treatment is unavailable through government-sponsored channels.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from Mr. Nansi's urgent need for a heart transplant due to severe cardiomyopathy. Because no Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS)-approved hospital in Mumbai was equipped to perform the procedure at the time, he underwent the transplant at a private facility. The CGHS authorities initially approved a reimbursement based on an outdated CGHS-Mumbai rate of \u20b969,000, which was significantly lower than the actual expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court strongly criticized the CGHS's narrow, technical approach, asserting that rigid procedural compliance should give way to compassion and constitutional values in life-saving situations. The court highlighted that heart transplants are inherently urgent, the right to health is integral to Article 21, and the government has the power to relax guidelines in medical emergencies. It also emphasized that the lack of empanelled facilities cannot justify denying essential care and questioned the outdated and discriminatory reimbursement rates. The judgment reinforces that public health policies must prioritize the well-being and constitutional rights of individuals, especially in critical medical situations.</p>",

The ruling in *Sukrutkumar Babasaheb Bhandare vs. State of Maharashtra & Anr.* demonstrates a balanced judicial approach, considering both the accused's livelihood and the integrity of legal proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioner, Sukrutkumar Babasaheb Bhandare, was charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code based on a complaint filed by his wife. He sought permission to return to the US, where he is employed. The Sessions Court initially rejected his plea, citing potential disruption to the investigation and mediation. Subsequently, the petitioner filed a Writ Petition.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court considered arguments from both parties, including the husband's cooperation with authorities and the wife's concern regarding withheld documents. Through joint request and exploration, both parties agreed to certain conditions. The conditions are that the husband hand over all documents and certificates belonging to the wife, provide electronic data stored on his laptop,andundertaking to participate and cooperate in the trial without causing any obstruction or delay.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Ashwin D.

(Biscuit Division) versus the State of Maharashtra*, addressed the legality of industrial closures under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and the constitutional right to close a business per Article 19(1)(g). The case stemmed from Harinagar Sugar Mills Limited's (HSML) closure of its biscuit division following the termination of a long-standing job work agreement with Britannia Industries Limited (BIL).</p>\n\n<p>HSML applied for closure, but the Government of Maharashtra requested additional information, which HSML provided. When the authorities requested resubmission, HSML argued that closure permission was automatically granted per Section 25-O(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, due to the government's failure to respond within 60 days. The Bombay High Court dismissed HSML's petitions, deeming the application incomplete.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court overturned the High Court's decision, holding that the initial request for information was not an order and the Deputy Secretary lacked the authority to request resubmission. The Court emphasized that the right to close a business is intrinsic to the right to conduct business under Article 19(1)(g), albeit subject to reasonable restrictions in the public interest under Article 19(6). The Court ruled that the 60-day period for deemed closure should be calculated from the initial application date, implying closure approval. HSML was directed to pay an additional Rs. 15 crores as compensation to the affected employees.</p>",

The reform aims to enhance prudence, borrower protection, and operational transparency within the gold loan sector.</p>\n\n<p>The new Directions consolidate and repeal over 30 circulars issued between 1964 and 2023, addressing inconsistencies and supervisory gaps arising from the previously fragmented regulatory structure. Applicable to a wide range of REs, the Directions will be fully effective by April 1, 2026, with loans sanctioned prior to this date remaining subject to the guidelines in effect at the time of issuance.</p>\n\n<p>Key provisions include restricting permissible collateral to gold and silver jewellery, ornaments, and coins, while prohibiting lending against primary gold/silver bullion or financial instruments backed by such assets. Loan-to-Value (LTV) caps have been introduced and must be maintained throughout the loan tenure, alongside standardized assaying and valuation procedures. Consumer protection measures, operational restrictions, AML checks, guidelines for top-up loans and renewals, collateral management, auction transparency, and provisions for unclaimed collateral are also outlined. Furthermore, lenders are required to disclose detailed loan portfolio information relating to gold and silver-backed loans in their financial statements.</p>\n\n<p>The RBI's 2025 Directions represent a forward-looking regulatory stance, unifying legacy norms into a single set of principles to promote responsible and transparent gold loan practices. Financial institutions are encouraged to view these guidelines as an opportunity to build trust and better serve customers, particularly those who rely on gold loans for short-term liquidity.</p>",

Furqan Ahmad Rather*, has streamlined procedures for cheque dishonor cases under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The Court ruled that the personal appearance of a Branch Manager is not mandatory for proving bank records. Any duly authorized bank official with access to the necessary records is competent to testify, thereby overturning a Trial Magistrate's overly strict procedural interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a Section 138 complaint where a cheque was dishonored due to insufficient funds. When the complainant presented an authorized bank representative in lieu of the Branch Manager, the Trial Magistrate refused to record their testimony, demanding a formal substitution application. The High Court found this insistence on procedural formalities to be excessive and legally incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Sanjay Dhar clarified that any responsible bank officer with access to account records in the ordinary course of business can testify to documentary evidence, such as cheque return memos, without needing personal knowledge. The Court also deemed the invocation of Section 302 of the Criminal Procedure Code unnecessary, as it obstructs the summary nature of Section 138 proceedings. The admissibility of such evidence is governed by Sections 65B and 67 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which facilitate the admission of electronic and documentary records maintained in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n\n<p>This decision aligns with existing legal principles promoting swift justice in cheque dishonor cases, as emphasized by the Supreme Court in *Indian Bank Association v.

The court emphasized that maintenance calculations should be based on the husband's earning capacity and gross income, excluding voluntary expenses, thus safeguarding dependent spouses and children from attempts to evade maintenance responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a marital dispute where the wife sought interim maintenance after the husband filed for divorce. The Family Court ordered the husband, with a declared monthly income of \u20b947,000, to pay \u20b915,000 monthly for the wife and child. The husband challenged this, arguing reduced disposable income due to loan obligations and insurance payments. The High Court rejected these arguments, stating that voluntary financial obligations cannot supersede the primary duty to maintain dependents.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's analysis aligned with the Supreme Court\u2019s stance in *Manish Jain v. Akanksha Jain*, emphasizing that financial commitments like home loans cannot dilute the legal duty of maintenance. The court also found the wife's unemployment to be genuine due to caregiving responsibilities, consistent with *Shailja & Anr. v. Khobbanna*, which affirms a qualified wife's entitlement to maintenance if she's not earning due to legitimate duties. The ruling reinforces the judiciary's commitment to protecting the financial well-being of spouses and children post-separation. Voluntary personal expenses cannot reduce statutory maintenance.

The Second Amendment, introduced in 2025, refines the framework by classifying mixed promotional content as promotional, requiring prior notification for auto-diallers, and implementing stricter provider obligations such as communication authentication and adherence to regulations. A key update is the abolishment of inferred consent from existing business relationships, mandating fresh consent after service contract termination.</p>\n\n<p>A streamlined complaint mechanism, featuring a standardised format and quicker response times, is now in place to bolster consumer control. Consumers can report UCC with minimal information, and service providers must respond within five days. Violators face penalties ranging from fines to blacklisting and service disconnection.

    "description": "<p>The Calcutta High Court recently ruled in favor of ITC Limited regarding their patent application for a \"Heater Assembly to Generate Aerosol,\" overturning the Controller of Patents' initial rejection. The Controller had cited Section 3(b) of the Patents Act, 1970, expressing concerns about public health and morality related to the device's potential use, particularly given the Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized that patent denials based solely on moral or public health grounds require independent scientific or technical evidence, and subjective notions are insufficient justification. The Controller's assumption that the invention was exclusively intended for tobacco products was incorrect, as the device could be used with various substrates.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Ravi Krishnan Kapur clarified that the e-cigarette ban addresses commercial activities, not the inherent patentability of an invention. Furthermore, the Controller's reliance on undisclosed documents violated principles of natural justice, denying ITC an opportunity to respond and rendering the decision procedurally flawed. The court has reaffirmed that bans on sale or distribution of products do not automatically equate to a ban on innovation and that health regulations should not unduly influence patent decisions.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the High Court set aside the Controller's order and remanded the matter for a fresh decision, stressing the need for a hearing and adherence to scientific and technical grounds. This ruling underscores the importance of relying on evidence-based assessments in patent law and establishes a narrower interpretation of Section 3(b), reinforcing the separation between health regulations and patent eligibility.</p>",

    "title": "Breaking the Mold: Can Courts Now Rewrite Arbitral Awards?",
    "description": "<p>In *Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd.*, a Supreme Court Constitution Bench addressed the power of Indian courts to modify arbitral awards under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The 4:1 majority held that limited judicial modification is permissible in specific circumstances, including clerical errors, severable portions, post-award interest, and under Article 142. This departs from the earlier decision in *NHAI v. Hakeem*, raising concerns about judicial overreach and its impact on the finality and autonomy of arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from conflicting judicial opinions regarding the power of Indian courts to modify arbitral awards, with some allowing it and others ruling against it. The Supreme Court aimed to resolve whether courts can modify awards or only set them aside. The Arbitration Act, modeled on the UNCITRAL Model Law, emphasizes limited court intervention, primarily allowing courts to set aside awards on specific grounds. However, the *Balasamy* ruling permits modifications in limited cases, sparking debate.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters argue that limited judicial modifications promote judicial economy and prevent delays. Opponents maintain that such powers conflict with the legislative intent of the Arbitration Act, potentially undermining arbitration's core principles and inviting further litigation. The ruling endorses judicial modifications under narrow circumstances and constitutional powers under Article 142. This interpretation has raised concerns about the integrity and indivisibility of arbitral awards, as well as potentially breaching the separation of powers.</p>\n\n<p>The majority's expansive view of Section 34 risks tactical litigation, weakens tribunal authority, and erodes arbitration\u2019s finality. Arbitral awards are generally unified instruments, and selectively modifying them compromises their coherence. Justice K.V. Viswanathan's dissent underscores that Article 142 cannot override clear statutory provisions, stressing judicial restraint and respect for legislative boundaries. Ultimately, the *Balasamy* decision introduces a nuanced approach, allowing limited court modifications, including severing invalid portions, correcting errors, modifying post-award interest, and invoking Article 142 to ensure complete justice.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in the case of *Kashmiri Lal Sharma v. Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board*, addressed the issue of retirement age disparities among employees with disabilities. The appellant, a 60% locomotor-disabled electrician, challenged his retirement at age 58, arguing it violated Article 14 of the Constitution due to an earlier Office Memorandum (OM) that allowed visually impaired employees to work until 60. The State later withdrew this OM, reverting the retirement age to 58 for all categories.</p>\n\n<p>The Court reaffirmed that setting the retirement age is a policy decision within the executive's purview, subject to the principles of equality. The appellant contended that the disparity violated Article 14 and that he had a legitimate expectation to work until 60 due to the OM's earlier existence. Conversely, the State argued that the OM's withdrawal negated any claims for extended retirement.</p>\n\n<p>Referencing the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 1995, and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016, the Court emphasized the need for equal treatment regarding employment benefits for individuals with benchmark disabilities. While partially allowing the appeal, the Court ruled that the appellant was entitled to full wages and benefits until the OM's withdrawal date (November 4, 2019) and that his pension should be calculated accordingly. The Court firmly stated that employees do not have a vested right to continue employment beyond the date of the OM's withdrawal, reinforcing the executive's right to determine retirement age through policy decisions, while still adhering to constitutional principles of fairness and equality.</p>",

This ruling underscores the importance of Section 65 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, which safeguards against the abuse of the Code's process.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a dispute where the Appellants initiated CIRP under Section 7, claiming to be financial creditors. The Respondent argued that the CIRP was a fraudulent attempt to defeat ongoing litigation related to the illegal dilution of their shareholding. The Adjudicating Authority terminated the CIRP, citing collusion, document fabrication, and misuse of the insolvency process.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT affirmed the NCLT\u2019s findings, emphasizing that the existence of debt and default does not shield a Section 7 application from scrutiny under Section 65 when collusion or abuse is proven. The Tribunal found significant documentary inconsistencies, violations of corporate law, manipulation of timing, and corroborative evidence of fraud. The Court clarified that terminating the CIRP was an adjudication on fraud and not a review of the admission order.</p>\n\n<p>This decision reinforces the judiciary's commitment to preventing the strategic abuse of the IBC, 2016. While Section 7 allows creditors to initiate CIRP based on financial debt and default, this mechanism is subject to scrutiny. Section 65 empowers the Adjudicating Authority to annul proceedings tainted by fraud or bad faith, thereby protecting the integrity of the Code.</p>",

These criteria include the absence of pending disciplinary proceedings, no convictions in the last three years, submission of an expression of interest in Form A by June 22, 2025, and holding a valid Authorization for Assignment (AFA). The expression of interest constitutes an unconditional consent to act in any specified role.</p>\n\n<p>The IBBI will create a zone-wise and bench-wise common panel of IPs valid for six months, which will be shared with the Adjudicating Authority. The sorting criteria will be based on the volume of ongoing assignments related to liquidation and corporate insolvency resolution processes, with the registration date with the Board serving as a tie-breaker. IPs included in the panel are expected to accept appointments unless otherwise permitted by the NCLT, DRT, or IBBI, with unjustified refusals resulting in removal from the panel for six months.</p>\n\n<p>These guidelines also stipulate that IPs must not surrender their registration or membership during the panel's validity. While the Adjudicating Authority retains the discretion to appoint any IP from the panel, the overarching goal of the new guidelines is to ensure a streamlined and efficient IP appointment process, thereby improving the effectiveness of the IBC.

This action, taken under the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023 through the insertion of Paragraph 2.20A, is aimed at safeguarding national security and public policy.</p>\n\n<p>The legal basis for the ban is rooted in Section 3 read with Section 5 of the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992, as well as Paragraphs 1.02 and 2.01 of the FTP 2023. These provisions grant the Central Government the authority to regulate trade activities that could pose a threat to national interests.

It provides a legal basis for social security, occupational health and safety, transparency in automated monitoring systems, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms. A \"gig worker\" is defined as an individual performing work based on a contract with a specified rate of payment, typically through a digital platform. Platforms are digital arrangements that assign tasks, while aggregators are digital intermediaries. A welfare fee, ranging from 1% to 5% of a worker's payout, will be levied on platforms to fund these entitlements.</p>\n\n<p>To administer the ordinance, a dedicated Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers Welfare Board will be established, comprising government officials, worker and aggregator representatives, civil society members, and technical experts. This statutory body, headquartered in Bengaluru, will have the power to acquire assets, enter into contracts, and initiate legal action. Platforms are required to register with the Board, provide fair contracts, and ensure transparency in algorithmic management.</p>\n\n<p>A Karnataka Gig Workers Social Security and Welfare Fund will be created, financed by welfare fees, voluntary contributions, government grants, and other permitted sources.

    "description": "<p>The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has announced the Fourth Amendment Regulations to the Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons, effective May 26, 2025. These amendments aim to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and fairness of the corporate insolvency resolution process, aligning with the goals of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC).</p>\n\n<p>Key changes include the insertion of a new sub-regulation allowing the committee of creditors to invite interim finance providers as observers to meetings, fostering better financial management. Furthermore, resolution professionals, with committee approval, can now solicit expressions of interest for resolution plans covering the entire corporate debtor or individual assets, broadening potential solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Additional amendments focus on creditor equity and regulatory clarity. A new provision ensures financial creditors who did not support the resolution plan receive proportional and prioritized payments. Revisions to Regulation 39 enhance compliance by explicitly including non-compliant plans in the review process, reinforcing adherence to the IBC and its regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the Fourth Amendment Regulations represent a significant effort by the IBBI to refine the insolvency resolution framework. By increasing flexibility, ensuring fair treatment of creditors, and clarifying regulatory language, these amendments aim to benefit all stakeholders, including corporate debtors, creditors, and the overall economy through a more robust and transparent insolvency resolution process.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In <b>State of Rajasthan v. Balchand alias Baliay (1977)</b>, the Supreme Court of India, led by Justice <b>V.R. Krishna Iyer</b>, affirmed the principle that <b>bail is the rule and jail is the exception</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The accused, <b>Balchand alias Baliay</b>, was convicted of housebreaking and theft under <b>Sections 457</b> and <b>380</b> of the <b>Indian Penal Code</b>. During his appeal against the conviction, he was granted interim bail, which the <b>State of Rajasthan</b> challenged on the grounds that a conviction extinguishes the presumption of innocence.</p>\n\n<p>The Court considered whether a conviction automatically deprives an accused of the right to bail pending appeal, and how to balance <b>societal security</b> with an individual\u2019s <b>fundamental liberty</b>. The prosecution contended that conviction nullifies the presumption of innocence and mandates bail cancellation, while the defense argued that the appeal process is an extension of the trial and preserves the accused\u2019s right to liberty until final judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Krishna Iyer\u2019s judgment emphasized that the <b>presumption of innocence</b> endures until all appellate remedies are exhausted. He underscored that under <b>Article 21</b> of the Constitution, personal liberty must be deprived only through a process that is just, fair, and reasonable. The Court held that \u201c<b>bail is the rule</b>\u201d and that bail may be denied only in exceptional circumstances such as flight risk, tampering with evidence, or threat to public order. It ruled that bail cannot be revoked automatically upon conviction, but must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, ensuring the justice system protects both liberty and public interest.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling established the foundation of modern <b>bail jurisprudence</b> in India, affirming that even a convicted person retains dignity and the right to judicial review. It has guided subsequent judgments to resist mechanical denials of bail and reinforced that restrictions on liberty must be grounded in substantial reasons.</p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, the decision balances <b>personal freedom</b> and <b>public safety</b>, favoring release unless compelling reasons demand custody. As Justice Krishna Iyer eloquently stated: \u201c<b>Bail is the rule and jail is the exception.</b>\u201d</p>",

    "description": "<p>The case of <b>Commander K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra</b> (1959) remains one of the most significant criminal trials in Indian jurisprudence, fundamentally altering perceptions of jury trials and the defense of provocation.</p>\n\n<p>Commander Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati, a distinguished officer of the Indian Navy, lived in Mumbai with his wife Sylvia and their children. When Sylvia\u2019s extramarital affair with Prem Ahuja, a wealthy businessman, came to light, Nanavati confronted them. In an emotionally charged encounter, he took his service revolver and went to Prem Ahuja\u2019s residence, where he fatally shot him.</p>\n\n<p>Key legal questions arose: whether Nanavati\u2019s act amounted to murder under <b>Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)</b>, and whether it could be reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <b>Exception 1 to Section 300 IPC</b> for grave and sudden provocation.</p>\n\n<p>At the Bombay Sessions Court, a jury trial returned a \u201cNot Guilty\u201d verdict by 8:1. The Sessions Judge, deeming the jury\u2019s decision perverse and influenced by media sympathy, referred the case to the Bombay High Court under <b>Section 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</b>. The High Court reversed the jury\u2019s verdict, finding Nanavati guilty of murder\u2014a conviction later upheld by the Supreme Court of India.</p>\n\n<p>The courts examined whether provocation was truly sudden and overwhelming. Finding that Nanavati had time to plan\u2014retrieving his revolver and traveling to Ahuja\u2019s home\u2014the defense of sudden provocation was rejected. The case also exposed media influence on juries, leading to the abolition of jury trials in Indian criminal law during the 1960s.</p>\n\n<p>Nanavati served his sentence but was subsequently pardoned by the Governor of Maharashtra after significant public and political support. His story inspired numerous films, books, and debates, most famously the Bollywood movie <b>Rustom</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The <b>Nanavati case</b> stands as a milestone in Indian criminal law, clarifying the limits of the provocation defense, highlighting the vulnerabilities of jury-based trials, and prompting the end of the jury system in India.</p>",

    "title": "Cheque Bounce Recovery in India: Your Legal Options Explained",
    "description": "<p>In India, a <b>cheque bounce</b>, technically known as <b>dishonor of cheque</b>, is a criminal offense punishable under Section 138 of the <b>Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881</b>. This happens when a bank refuses to honor a cheque due to insufficient funds in the drawer's account, or for other reasons like signature mismatch. For an ordinary citizen, receiving a bounced cheque can be a frustrating experience, but it's crucial to understand the legal options available to recover the owed amount.</p>\n\n<p>The process for <b>cheque bounce recovery</b> begins with sending a legal notice to the issuer of the cheque. This notice must be sent within 30 days from the date the bank informs you about the dishonor of the cheque. The notice should demand payment of the cheque amount within 15 days. If the issuer fails to make the payment within this period, you have the right to file a criminal complaint in the court of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, within one month from the date of expiry of the 15-day notice period. This initiates legal proceedings under Section 138 of the <b>Negotiable Instruments Act</b>.</p>\n\n<p>A critical aspect of the <b>Section 138</b> case is establishing that the debt or liability exists. The onus is on the complainant to prove that the cheque was issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or other liability. The drawer of the cheque has the opportunity to defend themselves, and the court will consider both sides before delivering a judgment. If the court finds the accused guilty, they can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the criminal proceedings under Section 138, it's also possible to initiate a civil suit for recovery of money. While the criminal case aims to penalize the defaulter, a civil suit aims to recover the outstanding amount along with interest and other costs. Filing a civil suit doesn't preclude initiating criminal proceedings, and both can proceed simultaneously. The legal recourse available to an individual who receives a <b>bounced cheque</b> provides substantial protection, ensuring that financial transactions are honored and that remedies are available when defaults occur.</p>",

    "title": "Indian Landlord Rights: Eviction Rules You Need to Know",
    "description": "<p>In India, landlords have specific rights when it comes to evicting a tenant, governed primarily by the respective state's <b>Rent Control Act</b>. These Acts vary across states, but generally, a landlord cannot evict a tenant at will. A valid and legal ground for eviction must exist, such as non-payment of rent, causing nuisance, subletting without permission, or using the property for illegal activities. It's crucial for landlords to understand the specific provisions of the Rent Control Act applicable in their state to ensure any eviction process complies with the law.</p>\n\n<p>The process of eviction typically involves serving a legal notice to the tenant, clearly stating the reason for eviction and giving them a reasonable timeframe to vacate the premises. If the tenant fails to comply, the landlord can then file an eviction suit in the appropriate court. The court will then hear both sides of the argument, examining the evidence presented by both the landlord and the tenant. The burden of proof usually lies with the landlord to demonstrate that a valid ground for eviction exists under the relevant <b>Rent Control Act</b>. Landlords must keep accurate records of rent payments, communication with the tenant, and any violations of the rental agreement to support their case.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that even with a valid reason for eviction, a landlord cannot use force or illegal means to evict a tenant. Such actions can result in legal repercussions for the landlord, including penalties and damages. The eviction process must be carried out through the court, obtaining a court order for eviction if necessary. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of following due process of law in eviction matters. For example, the landmark case of *Raghunath G. Panhale (Dead) By Lrs. v. M/S. Chaganlal Sundarji And Co* highlighted the need for strict adherence to procedural laws in eviction proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>For ordinary citizens who are landlords, understanding these <b>eviction rules</b> is crucial for protecting their property rights while also acting within the bounds of the law. Seeking legal advice from a lawyer specializing in property law is highly recommended before initiating any eviction proceedings. This ensures compliance with the state's specific Rent Control Act and minimizes the risk of legal complications. Moreover, familiarizing oneself with relevant case laws can provide a better understanding of how courts interpret and apply these laws in practice. Remember that a fair and legal eviction process protects both the landlord's rights and the tenant's rights, promoting a more equitable rental relationship.</p>",

    "title": "Online Fraud Refund: Your Rights Under Indian Law",
    "description": "<p>If you've fallen victim to <b>online fraud</b> in India, knowing your rights concerning a <b>refund</b> is crucial. Indian law provides avenues for recovering lost funds, though the process can sometimes be complex. The primary legislation governing such issues is the <b>Information Technology Act, 2000</b>, which addresses cybercrimes and provides a framework for holding fraudsters accountable. Banks and payment service providers also have a responsibility to ensure secure transactions, and their negligence can lead to liability.</p>\n\n<p>The liability of banks in cases of <b>unauthorized electronic transactions</b> is often governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. These guidelines typically differentiate liability based on customer reporting timelines. If the customer reports the fraudulent transaction promptly (usually within 3 days), the liability is often limited or even zero. Delay in reporting can increase the customer's potential liability. Banks are required to have a robust dispute resolution mechanism to handle customer complaints regarding fraudulent transactions and provide a refund, if warranted. It is important to document all communications with the bank and file a formal complaint with evidence of the <b>fraudulent transaction</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond banking regulations, Section 43 of the <b>IT Act</b> deals with compensation for damages caused to computer systems and networks due to unauthorized access or disruption. While it may not directly guarantee a <b>refund</b>, it allows for claiming damages. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the <b>online fraud</b>, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) provisions related to cheating, forgery, and criminal breach of trust can also be invoked. Registering a First Information Report (FIR) with the police is a crucial step in initiating a criminal investigation and strengthens your case for seeking legal remedies.</p>\n\n<p>For ordinary citizens, the practical implication is to be vigilant and proactive. Immediately report any <b>online fraud</b> to your bank and the cybercrime cell. Keep records of all transactions and communication. File a police complaint to initiate formal investigation. Familiarizing yourself with RBI guidelines on limiting liability in fraudulent transactions can greatly help navigate the process of claiming a <b>refund</b>. Remember, acting quickly and diligently is essential to maximizing your chances of recovering your funds.</p>",

    "title": "Live-in Relationships in India: Know Your Legal Rights",
    "description": "<p>In India, a <b>live-in relationship</b> refers to an arrangement where two individuals choose to cohabit and share their lives together without being legally married. This form of relationship has gained increasing social acceptance, and the Indian legal system has gradually recognized certain rights and protections for couples in such arrangements. However, it's crucial to understand that live-in relationships don't automatically grant the same rights as a marriage. Proof of a relationship resembling marriage, including factors like duration, shared household, pooling of resources, and intent to marry, is often essential for claiming legal entitlements.</p>\n\n<p>Several landmark court judgments have shaped the legal landscape surrounding live-in relationships. The Supreme Court, in cases like D. Patchaiammal v. D. Velusamy, has laid down guidelines for determining the validity and nature of a live-in relationship. To be considered a valid relationship warranting legal protection, the couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses. Importantly, not all cohabitation qualifies as a live-in relationship entitled to legal rights. The court has emphasized the necessity of a long-standing and genuine relationship similar to marriage. These judicial pronouncements primarily aim to prevent exploitation and protect vulnerable partners within such arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>The legal implications for women in <b>live-in relationships</b> are particularly significant. While not explicitly covered under the Hindu Marriage Act, certain legislations like the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provide some recourse. This Act recognizes women in live-in relationships as being in a relationship \"in the nature of marriage,\" thereby entitling them to protection from domestic violence, including physical, emotional, and economic abuse. They can seek remedies such as residence orders, monetary relief, and protection orders under this Act. Further, children born out of live-in relationships are considered legitimate and have inheritance rights in their parents\u2019 property, as established by various court decisions.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that establishing legal rights within a <b>live-in relationship</b> can often be challenging. Unlike a formal marriage certificate, there's no single document that automatically proves the existence of the relationship or its nature. Individuals need to gather evidence, such as joint bank accounts, utility bills with both names, photographs, and testimonies of friends and family, to demonstrate the validity and characteristics of their relationship to the court. Seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer is highly recommended for individuals in live-in relationships to understand their rights and obligations and to navigate the legal complexities effectively. This is especially crucial in cases involving property disputes, maintenance claims, or inheritance matters.</p>",
