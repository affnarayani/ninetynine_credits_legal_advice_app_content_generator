    "title": "No Automatic Consumer Liability For Brand Ambassadors: Kerala High Court On Unfair Trade Practices",
    "description": "<p>The Kerala High Court, in a significant judgment in Actor Mohanlal Vishwanath vs. State of Kerala and Anr., clarified that celebrity endorsers cannot be automatically held liable in consumer complaints alleging unfair trade practices or deficiency of service solely based on their appearance in advertisements. The ruling emphasizes that liability under consumer law must be anchored to statutory mandate and direct transactional involvement.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a complaint against actor Mohanlal, who was the brand ambassador for Manappuram Finance. Complainants, purportedly influenced by advertisements featuring Mohanlal, availed a gold loan but later alleged they were charged a higher interest rate than advertised. Consequently, they impleaded Mohanlal as an opposite party in their consumer complaint, attributing his involvement solely to his endorsement of the company. The District and State Consumer Commissions had previously upheld the maintainability of the complaint against him.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court overturned these decisions, asserting that a direct legal nexus between the endorser and the consumer transaction is crucial for imposing liability in cases of unfair trade practice or service deficiency. The court found no direct link between Mohanlal and the loan transaction, noting that assurances regarding interest rates were attributed to the finance company, not to the endorser's independent representations. It underscored that mere \"endorser\" status does not automatically create liability for service deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment further elucidated that Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, provides a specific, self-contained mechanism for addressing misleading advertisements, including provisions for due diligence defenses for endorsers. Therefore, liability for deficiency of service properly rests with the service provider. While the complaint against Mohanlal was deemed not maintainable, the complainants retain their remedies against the finance company and are at liberty to pursue claims concerning misleading advertisements under Section 21 before the competent authority. This ruling draws a clear doctrinal boundary, ensuring liability aligns with transactional involvement rather than mere association.</p>",

    "title": "India’s Insurance Law Reforms 2025: An Overview Of The Insurance 2.0 Framework",
    "description": "<p>India's Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance laws) Bill, 2025, or \"Insurance 2.0 Framework,\" introduces comprehensive reforms to modernize the sector. This legislative intervention aims to achieve \"Insurance for all,\" boost capital availability, enhance regulatory efficiency, improve governance standards, and strengthen policyholder protection. The reforms seek to reposition India within the global insurance ecosystem by addressing structural constraints like foreign ownership limits and rigid transaction frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>Key reforms include increasing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Indian insurers to 100% from the previous 74%, designed to unlock foreign capital and scale operations. To attract global reinsurers, the net owned fund requirement for foreign reinsurance branches is significantly reduced to INR 1,000 crore. The Bill also streamlines corporate actions by raising the IRDAI approval threshold for share transfers from 1% to 5% and expands the Mergers & Amalgamations framework to allow non-insurance business integration, facilitating group restructuring.</p>\n\n<p>The framework lays the groundwork for composite insurance licenses, potentially allowing insurers to operate across life, health, and general segments, fostering diversification. Regulatory flexibility is enhanced, empowering IRDAI to prescribe general commission caps, replacing product-specific limits. The definition of \"insurance business\" is expanded to include value-added and ancillary services. Governance is strengthened by broadly prohibiting directors or officers from serving simultaneously in other insurers of the same class, banking, or investment companies, preventing conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>Policyholder protection is bolstered through enhanced data collection requirements and formal mechanisms for accessing policy and claims data with consent. The reforms formally recognize new intermediaries, such as Managing General Agents (MGAs) and insurance repositories, promoting specialized participation and niche product development. Operational efficiency is improved via one-time registration for intermediaries (replacing three-year renewals), formal recognition of online premium payments, and mandatory corporate naming conventions.</p>\n\n<p>These reforms signify a structural recalibration of India's insurance sector, combining market liberalization with strengthened regulatory oversight. Their successful implementation, dependent on clear and consistent regulations, is crucial for deepening insurance penetration, promoting sustainable growth, and reinforcing India's position as a competitive and well-regulated insurance market.</p>",

    "title": "The Great Indian Bustard Judgment: Redefining Corporate Social Responsibility As Environmental Duty",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court's landmark judgment in M.K. Ranjitsinh & Others v. Union of India has fundamentally redefined Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in India, transforming it from a mechanism of voluntary welfare into a mandatory Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER). Delivered in response to the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB), this ruling establishes CSR as a constitutional and fiduciary obligation, integrating ecological preservation with corporate economic activities.</p>\n\n<p>The litigation stemmed from the precipitous decline of the GIB, primarily due to collisions with overhead power lines from energy projects. While an earlier interim order restricted such lines, the Union Government sought modification citing renewable energy commitments. The Court then appointed an Expert Committee, whose recommendations form the basis of this judgment.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's reasoning is rooted in constitutional duties (Articles 48A, 51A(g)), Companies Act provisions (Sections 135, 166), and environmental principles like Polluter Pays. It categorically states that corporate profit is partly owed to the society and environment enabling its generation, asserting that \"Social Responsibility\" must inherently include \"Environmental Responsibility.\" Directors' fiduciary duties now explicitly encompass environmental protection, shifting from shareholder primacy to a broader stakeholder view.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment approves revised GIB priority conservation areas (14,013 sq. km. in Rajasthan, 740 sq. km. in Gujarat). Within these zones, it prohibits new renewable energy projects and new overhead power transmission lines (except 11 KV and below). For existing high-voltage lines, it directs an action plan for undergrounding or installing bird diverters. It also mandates intensified in-situ conservation efforts, linking them directly to CSR funding. This ruling ensures that economic development respects ecological limits, positioning corporations as trustees of ecosystems and obligating them to constitutional stewardship, not merely charity.</p>",

    "title": "When Identity Becomes Commodity: Personality Rights In The Digital Age",
    "description": "<p>The digital age and artificial intelligence have dramatically increased the commercial exploitation of personal identity in India, propelling the significance of personality rights—an individual's right to control the commercial use of their name, likeness, and voice. Despite a surge in cases involving unauthorized use, deepfakes, and AI-generated content, India currently lacks a dedicated statutory framework, compelling affected individuals to rely on fragmented legal provisions.</p>\n\n<p>Indian courts have incrementally developed personality rights from constitutional principles, tort law, and intellectual property. Landmark judgments like Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India affirmed privacy as a fundamental right, laying the groundwork for identity control. Subsequent cases such as D.M. Entertainment and Titan Industries recognized the independent commercial value inherent in a celebrity's persona. Recent rulings involving Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have issued injunctions against the misuse of names, images, voices, and even mannerisms, particularly when enhanced by AI technologies. The Kamal Haasan case further introduced \"John Doe\" injunctions, offering pre-emptive protection against anticipated digital exploitation.</p>\n\n<p>However, judicial protection for personality rights has limits. The Siddiqua Begum Khan v. Union of India case (Shah Bano) unequivocally established that personality rights, including privacy and reputation, are personal to an individual and extinguish upon death. This ruling rejected posthumous claims by legal heirs, highlighting a distinct contrast with the robust protection afforded to living individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, remedies against deepfakes and AI-driven identity misuse are piecemeal, drawing upon copyright law, trademark law, and select sections of the Information Technology Act, 2000, alongside administrative advisories from MeitY. This regulatory vacuum underscores an urgent need for comprehensive legislation to directly address consent, commercial exploitation, and AI-driven replication of personality in the digital age, moving beyond reactive judicial pronouncements.</p>",

    "title": "From Fortuity To Equality: SC Declares Post-Death Widowhood No Bar To Claim Under Sections 21 & 22, Hindu Adoptions & Maintenance Act",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Kanchana Rai v. Geeta Sharma & Uma Devi v. Geeta Sharma, has decisively ruled that a daughter-in-law widowed after her father-in-law's death is a \"dependant\" under Section 21(vii) of the Hindu Adoptions & Maintenance Act, 1956 (HAMA) and can claim maintenance from his estate under Section 22. This judgment, delivered by Justices Pankaj Mithal and S.V.N. Bhatti, effectively removes the temporal coincidence of widowhood as a precondition, reinforcing HAMA's overarching mission to protect vulnerable relatives.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from the estate of Dr. Mahendra Prasad. His daughter-in-law, Geeta Sharma, became a widow after Dr. Prasad's demise and sought maintenance. The Family Court initially dismissed her petition, interpreting \"any widow of his son\" in Section 21(vii) narrowly to exclude widows whose husbands survived the father-in-law. The High Court reversed this, stating the expression was not temporally qualified. Appellants Kanchana Rai and Uma Devi argued for a narrower reading, citing testamentary freedom and contending that Section 19's personal obligation on the father-in-law extinguished upon his death.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court affirmed the High Court's decision, emphasizing that the legislature's omission of \"predeceased\" in Section 21(vii) was deliberate. A restrictive interpretation, the Court reasoned, would violate Article 14 by creating an irrational classification lacking a rational nexus to the Act's protective objective and Article 21 by threatening the right to life with dignity. The Court stressed that social welfare legislation like HAMA prevails over testamentary autonomy, and Section 22 establishes an enduring charge on the estate, reflecting heirs' pious obligation to uphold the deceased's moral duties. The appeals were dismissed, reinstating the direction for the Family Court to quantify Geeta Sharma's maintenance, underscoring that wills cannot override the fundamental economic safety net guaranteed to statutory dependants.</p>",

    "title": "Unilateral Appointments on Trial: The Supreme Court’s Reaffirmation of Arbitrator Neutrality",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Bhadra International (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. v. Airports Authority of India, significantly reaffirmed the mandatory nature of Section 12(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. This judgment strictly prohibits unilateral arbitrator appointments by parties with a controlling interest, reinforcing the foundational principles of neutrality, independence, and equality in arbitral proceedings, consistent with post-2015 arbitration jurisprudence.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from licence agreements where the Airports Authority of India (AAI) appointed a sole arbitrator, despite its Chairman (who made the appointment) falling under the Seventh Schedule's ineligibility criteria. The appellants, initially participating in proceedings, later challenged the appointment under Section 12(5) during Section 34 applications.</p>\n\n<p>The Court examined three critical issues: the arbitrator's ineligibility under Section 12(5), whether the appellants waived this right, and if the challenge was maintainable at the Section 34 stage. It held that Section 12(5), with its non-obstante clause, renders such unilateral appointments void ab initio, as the AAI Chairman was statutorily ineligible to appoint an arbitrator.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, the Court ruled that waiver of Section 12(5) requires an \"express agreement in writing\" entered into after disputes have arisen. Mere participation, silence, or a \"no objection\" recorded in procedural orders is insufficient to waive this mandatory statutory protection. Furthermore, such fundamental ineligibility constitutes a de jure inability under Section 14(1)(a), meaning the challenge can be raised at any stage, including Section 34 proceedings, as it invalidates the entire arbitral process.</p>\n\n<p>By allowing the appeals and setting aside the award, the Supreme Court emphasized that party autonomy must yield to statutory safeguards ensuring fairness and eliminating perceived bias. This robust ruling fortifies the credibility of Indian arbitration, cautioning practitioners and contracting parties to ensure arbitration clauses and appointment mechanisms strictly adhere to statutory requirements to prevent the nullification of proceedings.</p>",

    "title": "From Choice To Compliance: Regulating Live-In Relationships In India’s Emerging Legal Order",
    "description": "<p>Indian constitutional law previously treated live-in relationships as private matters, intervening only for protection, not permission, upholding adult autonomy under Article 21. Landmark judgments like Lata Singh and S Khushboo emphasized non-interference, refusing to criminalize cohabitation and warning against using criminal law for social morality. Legal protections, such as those \"in the nature of marriage,\" were welfare-driven, triggered by vulnerability, and did not mandate registration. This approach reflected a deliberate constitutional design focused on liberty through non-intervention.</p>\n\n<p>However, this judicial settlement is unravelling, marking a decisive shift towards state regulation. Uttarakhand’s Uniform Civil Code (2025) transforms live-in relationships into registrable legal events, requiring couples to notify the State, disclose personal details, and formally record termination, with criminal penalties for non-compliance. Justified as protection, this regime preemptively presumes risk, acting as a licensing mechanism for intimacy. This contravenes the Puttaswamy judgment's emphasis on decisional autonomy and proportionality; a right conditioned on disclosure becomes permission, not an inherent liberty.</p>\n\n<p>Further, Section 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 criminalizes sexual relations obtained by \"deceitful means,\" specifically including unfulfilled promises of marriage. This provision risks conflating emotional uncertainty with dishonest intent at a relationship's inception, a distinction Indian courts previously maintained. It invites retrospective reconstruction of intent, potentially converting private relational history and relationship breakdowns into penal liability, a task for which criminal law is ill-suited due to its demand for certainty.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, existing welfare mechanisms like maintenance and domestic violence remedies continue to operate without requiring registration or criminal complaints, creating a \"constitutional schizophrenia\" where the State simultaneously trusts and distrusts adults. This emerging framework, though framed as protective, revives moral governance through bureaucratic and criminal means. It replaces autonomy with audit, recasts relational uncertainty as criminal deceit, and risks transforming personal failure into penal liability. This shift raises fundamental questions about privacy, proportionality, and the constitutional limits of state power, signaling that constitutional liberty might be quietly rewritten if intimacy requires declaration for protection and choice must be justified to avoid punishment.</p>",

    "title": "The Inalienability Of Ownership: A Jurisprudential Analysis Of Tenancy And Title Preservation In India",
    "description": "<p>Indian property law definitively establishes that long-term possession, such as tenancy, does not automatically confer ownership rights. This fundamental principle is upheld by the Transfer of Property Act (TPA) 1882, the Indian Evidence Act 1872, and consistent Supreme Court rulings. Ownership, defined as an exhaustive \"bundle of rights\" including disposal, is distinct from a lease, which merely grants a limited \"right to enjoy\" the property. Even a perpetual lease does not transfer absolute title, and tenants are legally obligated to return the property to the landlord.</p>\n\n<p>A crucial legal barrier to tenants claiming ownership is the doctrine of estoppel, codified in Section 116 of the Indian Evidence Act. This prevents tenants from denying their landlord's title during the tenancy. The maxim \"Once a tenant, always a tenant\" signifies that a tenant's status remains unchanged by the passage of time or non-payment of rent, unless legally altered by a new contract.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the doctrine of adverse possession, which requires \"hostile, open, and continuous\" occupation for 12 years, does not apply to tenants, as their possession is \"permissive,\" not hostile. Recent Supreme Court judgments, including Jyoti Sharma v. Vishnu Goyal (2025), have unequivocally reaffirmed that decades of occupation do not convert tenancy into ownership, upholding the \"cardinal estoppel.\"</p>\n\n<p>While state Rent Control Acts provide statutory protections to tenants, these confer personal rights to occupy, not proprietary interests. The Model Tenancy Act, 2021, aims to formalize rental agreements and expedite landlord repossession. Indian jurisprudence consistently safeguards absolute ownership, ensuring that the contractual nature of tenancy remains a steadfast barrier to acquiring title through mere duration of stay.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In RattanIndia Power Limited vs MSEDCL (2025), the Supreme Court clarified crucial aspects concerning remand proceedings, appellate finality, and the computation of carrying costs, particularly regarding compounding interest. RattanIndia sought compensation for 'Change in Law' events under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), with the dispute centering on the application of Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) rates and whether compounding interest should apply.</p>\n\n<p>The Court held that a remand for fresh consideration does not freeze the legal position; adjudicatory bodies must apply prevailing law, as the \"lis\" remains active during the remand period. It deemed MSEDCL's failure to cross-appeal APTEL's grant of carrying costs at LPS rates as making that aspect final and unchallengeable.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding compounding interest, the SC clarified that while LPS rates applied, compounding is not automatic. It requires a specific factual assessment, such as whether the affected party incurred financing costs with monthly rests. The Court found APTEL erred by denying compounding on the erroneous assumption that the previous remand order precluded such consideration, rather than on factual merit.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the SC partly allowed the appeal, remanding the matter to APTEL for a fresh factual determination on compounding interest. This judgment reinforces that remand proceedings are not static, requiring adjudicatory bodies to consider evolving legal principles. It also underscores the finality of unchallenged appellate findings and adopts a nuanced approach to restitution, requiring a factual basis for compounding interest, rather than automatic application.</p>",

The case exposed how weak identity verification mechanisms allow fraudsters to register domain names closely resembling well-known brands, like Dabur, and create cloned websites. These fraudulent sites deceive the public into paying \"registration fees\" for fake distributorships, franchises, or job opportunities, only to vanish and resurface with new, slightly altered domains, making traditional legal remedies ineffective.</p>\n\n<p>The court observed the widespread, organised nature of this fraud, affecting numerous companies beyond Dabur, with over 1,100 infringing domains identified where registrant details were often false or masked. Justice Pratibha M Singh acknowledged that domain names are critical commercial indicators and that such systematic deception, operating at scale and speed, necessitates structural solutions beyond isolated injunctions.</p>\n\n<p>To address these vulnerabilities, the Court mandated e-KYC verification for domain name registrants to introduce accountability and traceability. It also directed measures to tackle banking system weaknesses exploited by fraudsters. Crucially, the ruling granted Dabur a dynamic plus injunction, allowing the company to tackle future deceptive domain variants without instituting fresh lawsuits. This judgment marks a pivotal shift from reactive adjudication to preventive regulation, strengthening enforcement for rights holders and offering greater protection to consumers by addressing the fraud at its source: the domain registration process.</p>",

Recognizing semiconductor design as the most IP-intensive segment of the chip value chain, the DLI Scheme ensures that valuable IP generated with public support remains anchored within India, reducing reliance on foreign technologies and advancing technological sovereignty.</p>\n\n<p>The scheme provides financial incentives, covering up to 50% of eligible design expenditure and 30% for product deployment, alongside crucial access to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and prototyping infrastructure. It is open to Indian startups, MSMEs, domestic companies, and research institutions. While beneficiaries retain IP ownership, the scheme mandates IP generation and patent filings within India, balancing private rights with national accountability.</p>\n\n<p>Since its launch in 2021, the DLI Scheme has shown significant progress. It has supported over 50 beneficiaries, leading to the development of 28 IPs/SoCs, over 100 patent filings, and more than 10 silicon tape-outs. Success stories include Vervesemi Microelectronics with its motor-control chips and 10 patents, InCore Semiconductors developing indigenous RISC-V processor IPs, Netrasemi's indigenously designed 12nm AI SoC, Aheesa Digital Innovations' fiber-broadband solutions, and AAGYAVISION's radar-on-chip solutions. These achievements demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in translating indigenous design capabilities into market-ready semiconductor products.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the DLI Scheme represents a strategic shift towards IP-led semiconductor growth. By lowering entry barriers and mitigating financial risks for innovators, it significantly contributes to India’s objectives of technological self-reliance and enhanced competitiveness in the global semiconductor design landscape.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Maharashtra Government has enacted a significant reform, empowering housing societies to directly apply for Occupancy Certificates (OCs), addressing a critical issue where developers often failed to secure them. An OC is crucial for legal occupation, confirming a building's compliance with essential services. Historically, developers held exclusive rights to apply, frequently leading to misuse of power and leaving residents in Mumbai and MMR vulnerable to legal, financial, and redevelopment risks due to uncertified properties.</p>\n\n<p>Under the new initiative, over 25,000 buildings, including those under BMC, MHADA, and SRA, can now seek full or partial OCs, either jointly or independently. A six-month window offers penalty waivers for timely applications, though premiums apply for utilized additional FSI. This policy aims to simplify compliance for over 10 lakh residents by offering premium discounts and easing administrative hurdles. It fundamentally shifts control from developers to residents, acknowledging that many buildings are already occupied and tax-paying, while still upholding safety and structural integrity checks.</p>\n\n<p>This reform streamlines redevelopment for older properties, provides an alternative compliance route for projects outside RERA, and significantly boosts marketability and title certainty—factors vital for lenders, buyers, and insurers. Although it doesn't imply legal amnesty and applications may be rejected for major non-compliances, it empowers societies to collectively resolve long-standing issues. The move is expected to enhance buyer confidence, mitigate conflicts, and ultimately elevate housing standards across Maharashtra, marking a pivotal step towards lawful regularization and seamless urban development.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The jurisprudence on impleading non-signatories in arbitration, especially post-Cox and Kings Ltd. v. SAP India Pvt. Ltd., emphasizes a balance between expanding arbitral jurisdiction and preventing its indiscriminate use. The Himachal Pradesh High Court, in Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi v. Central Public Works Department & Anr., reinforced that mere financial interest or project ownership does not constitute consent to arbitrate.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved IIT Mandi, which entered an MoU with CPWD for construction. CPWD then independently contracted a private contractor, with this contract containing an arbitration clause. When disputes arose between CPWD and the contractor, IIT Mandi sought impleadment in the arbitration, arguing a direct financial interest as any award against CPWD would ultimately be borne by IIT Mandi under their MoU. IIT Mandi contended that denial would violate natural justice and cited Supreme Court rulings on non-signatory binding. The contractor opposed, highlighting IIT Mandi's non-signatory status and lack of involvement in their contract.</p>\n\n<p>Both the arbitrator and the High Court rejected IIT Mandi's application. The High Court affirmed that arbitration is fundamentally consensual. IIT Mandi was not a signatory to the construction contract or its arbitration clause, and its MoU with CPWD was a distinct agreement. The Court ruled that financial consequences arising from a separate agreement do not automatically grant a non-signatory procedural rights in an unrelated arbitral proceeding. No express or implied consent by IIT Mandi to arbitrate with the contractor was found.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment signifies that the expansion of arbitration to non-signatories is an exception, not the rule. Courts will guard against transforming arbitration into multi-party civil litigation based solely on indirect financial implications. It cautions project owners and government bodies that downstream financial liability does not inherently confer arbitral procedural rights unless supported by clear contractual intent and conduct.

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, in a significant ruling by Justice Somasekhar Sundaresan in Reliance Naval & Engineering Ltd. v. Afcons Infrastructure Ltd., addressed the intersection of arbitration and insolvency law. The judgment held that an award-creditor, having withdrawn a court deposit, must return the funds if the underlying claim is subsequently extinguished by an approved resolution plan under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC), citing unjust enrichment.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Reliance Naval, a corporate debtor, against whom an arbitral award of ₹49.11 crores was passed in favor of Afcons Infrastructure. While challenging the award, Reliance deposited ₹12.76 crores in court, which Afcons withdrew after furnishing a bank guarantee, thus making the withdrawal conditional. Subsequently, Reliance entered corporate insolvency resolution, and its approved plan reduced Afcons' claim to a symbolic Re. 1, extinguishing the original debt and providing a \"clean slate\" to the corporate debtor. Reliance then sought the return of the withdrawn amount.</p>\n\n<p>Reliance argued that the finality of the resolution plan extinguished Afcons' entitlement, making the money, as a corporate debtor's asset, revert to the resolution applicant. Afcons countered that the money ceased to be Reliance's asset post-withdrawal and that the bank guarantee protected its interest.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Sundaresan ruled that upon approval of the resolution plan, Afcons' claim, deemed a \"debt\" under IBC, stood statutorily expunged. Continued retention of the withdrawn sum would therefore constitute unjust enrichment. The Court clarified that the custodia legis principle merely regulates the fund's physical location, not its beneficial ownership. When the award's substratum vanished, the condition for withdrawal failed, necessitating restoration of the money. However, the Court rejected Reliance's claim for interest, deeming it a new cause of action beyond the scope of an interim application in an infructuous Section 34 petition.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, Afcons was directed to re-deposit the sum, failing which its bank guarantee would be invoked. This decision reaffirms that an approved resolution plan overrides pre-existing adjudicatory labels, and funds held in court are not immune from the IBC's statutory waterfall mechanism, ultimately reverting to the corporate debtor's revitalized assets.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The hypothetical capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by United States forces would represent a profound challenge to international law, despite being framed as a domestic law-enforcement action. This operation would directly violate core principles of state sovereignty, the prohibition on the use of force, and the absolute personal immunity afforded to sitting heads of state under customary international law.</p>\n\n<p>Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits states from using force against another's territorial integrity, a principle reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Exceptions like self-defense or Security Council authorization would not apply, as transnational criminal conduct doesn't constitute an \"armed attack.\" Furthermore, customary international law, as affirmed by the ICJ in Arrest Warrant, grants heads of state absolute immunity from foreign criminal jurisdiction. A unilateral armed seizure on foreign soil is akin to extraordinary rendition, not legitimate law enforcement, creating international responsibility irrespective of domestic prosecution.</p>\n\n<p>Such an operation, involving the forcible capture of a sitting head of state, could be deemed an act of aggression, profoundly interfering with a state’s political independence. While not every unlawful use of force escalates into war, this could be classified as aggression, especially within a wider pattern of coercive conduct. Historical parallels, like the U.S. capture of Manuel Noriega, are not legal precedents; that invasion was widely condemned by the UN General Assembly for violating sovereignty.

    "title": "Landlord’s Bona Fide Need Prevails: Supreme Court Reins in Bombay HC’s Unwarranted Re-Appreciation of Evidence",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Rajani Manohar Kuntha & Anr. v. Parshuram Chunilal Kanojiya & Ors., definitively clarified that the supervisory jurisdiction of High Courts under Article 227 is not a conduit for re-hearing appeals or undertaking a microscopic re-evaluation of evidence. The Court set aside a Bombay High Court judgment that had overturned concurrent eviction decrees.</p>\n\n<p>The case centered on a landlord seeking possession of non-residential premises for their daughter-in-law’s commercial venture. Both the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court found the need to be bona fide and decreed eviction. However, the Bombay High Court, exercising its revisional powers, re-examined the evidence extensively, concluding that the landlord’s case was insufficiently proven and that the tenant’s offer of alternative accommodation was not adequately considered.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized that revisional powers are supervisory, reserved for instances where an inferior court's order is without jurisdiction or suffers from a glaring defect of law or procedure, not for delving deep into evidentiary terrain. It held that the High Court's actions amounted to an \"unauthorised re-trial,\" affirming that concurrent factual findings should not be disturbed unless perverse. The Court also reiterated that a tenant cannot impose alternative accommodation on a landlord and that a subsequent commercial electricity connection did not negate the landlord's genuine need for a property structurally suited for trade.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the SC allowed the appeal, restoring the judgments of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court, thereby reviving the eviction decree. Recognizing the tenants' five-decade occupation, the Court granted an extended period until June 30, 2026, for vacant possession, subject to clearing arrears and providing an undertaking. This decision reinforces the limited scope of revisional jurisdiction, ensuring predictability for landlords while balancing substantive rights with equitable considerations.</p>",

    "title": "Landmark Judgments in Arbitration (2025)",
    "description": "<p>The year 2025 witnessed several significant rulings in arbitration law across Indian courts. The Supreme Court notably affirmed that parties' conduct and correspondence can bind them to an unsigned arbitration agreement, rejecting attempts to escape terms based on a lack of signature. It also clarified that High Courts cannot review their Section 11 orders appointing arbitrators once the process has substantially progressed, upholding the principle of minimal judicial interference. Regarding the determination of governing law for arbitration agreements without explicit choice, the Court adopted the \"closest and most real connection\" test, generally linking it to the underlying contract's governing law. Furthermore, the Supreme Court ruled against appointing an arbitrator for non-parties to a contract under Section 11 and established the maintainability of writ petitions against Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act (MSMED Act) orders if the council acts without jurisdiction or violates natural justice.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court held that disputes arising from an ancillary agreement, even without an arbitration clause, could be referred to arbitration if the main agreement contains one, and confirmed that bilateral fraud allegations are arbitrable. Conversely, it ruled that disputes concerning the enforcement of mortgage rights are non-arbitrable due to involving rights in rem. The Court also permitted the partial setting aside of an arbitral award, specifically removing personal liability imposed on Designated Partners of an LLP while affirming the award against the LLP itself.</p>\n\n<p>The Delhi High Court, in its rulings, clarified that an exclusive jurisdiction clause in an agreement prevails over subsequent communications merely designating a different arbitration venue, asserting that the designated seat governs jurisdiction. It also declined to re-refer a claim to arbitration under Section 11 when a previous tribunal had already found no evidence to support it, preventing re-agitation of conclusively decided matters. Crucially, the Delhi High Court granted an anti-arbitration injunction in a foreign-seated arbitration, emphasizing its power to intervene in \"blatantly vexatious, unconscionable, oppressive\" proceedings or those violating public policy, such as an arbitrator's non-disclosure of a conflict of interest.</p>",

    "title": "No Forced Possession in Delayed Projects: REAT Jaipur Clarifies Scope of Refund Rights",
    "description": "<p>The Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, Jaipur (REAT), in Satish Sharma v. VVA Developers Pvt. Ltd., has significantly clarified allottees' refund rights under the RERA Act. This pivotal ruling underscores that project delay, non-execution of an Agreement for Sale, and arbitrary unit substitution decisively favor the allottee, even when promoters claim partial project completion.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from an allottee who booked a unit in 2013 and paid over 10% of the consideration, yet no Agreement for Sale was ever executed. Faced with prolonged delays and subsequent offers of different units after partial project completion, the allottee sought a full refund. The Regulatory Authority initially directed the promoter to either offer possession (with interest adjustment) or provide a refund minus 10% administrative charges if the allottee declined possession.</p>\n\n<p>REAT Jaipur modified this order, unequivocally stating that a promoter's failure to execute an Agreement for Sale (a breach of RERA Sections 13(1) and 13(2)) is a serious statutory violation, which prevents them from imposing contractual deductions like administrative charges. The Tribunal affirmed an allottee's unconditional right to a full refund with interest under Section 18(1) if possession is not delivered within the stipulated timeframe. Crucially, REAT ruled that refund rights are not diminished by partial project completion, belated possession offers, or unilateral substitution of units without the allottee's express consent. Allottees cannot be compelled to accept a unit never originally allotted to them.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the REAT directed the promoter to refund the entire deposited amount of ₹6,47,212 with applicable interest, without any deductions, within 45 days. This decision reinforces RERA's core objective to protect homebuyers from promoter non-compliance, strengthening the jurisprudence around remedies for delayed projects and statutory breaches.</p>",

    "title": "From Possession to Katha: KRERA Clarifies Developer’s Role in Title Completion",
    "description": "<p>The Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (KRERA) has issued a landmark ruling, directing a Bengaluru developer to facilitate katha (municipal property tax record) transfer to allottees within 30 days. This judgment, in Somashekar HG & Prakruti M v. Kavitha Ramreddy concerning project \"AQUATOWNN\", reinforces that post-sale title documentation is an enforceable obligation for promoters under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, not merely a formality.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from buyers' grievance of undue delay in katha mutation, despite an express undertaking in the indemnity bond and sale deed. These contractual documents explicitly stipulated the developer's responsibility to transfer/mutate e-katha within 60 days of sale deed registration. KRERA held that these covenants established a positive duty on the promoter to facilitate the mutation process. The Authority clarified that Section 17(1) of RERA views \"title completion\" as a trinity encompassing registered conveyance, occupancy certificate, and katha in the allottee's favour.</p>\n\n<p>While mandating specific performance for katha transfer, KRERA rejected the buyers' plea for EMI compensation. The Authority stated that RERA's remedial architecture, though pro-consumer, cannot create liabilities for ancillary financial outgoings absent explicit contractual stipulations. The order thus crystallises three key propositions: an indemnity bond under RERA constitutes an enforceable undertaking, katha facilitation is integral to title completion, and compensation for monetary fallout must be rooted in explicit contractual terms. This ruling aims to standardize katha hand-over mechanisms, reinforcing promoter accountability and guiding both developers and buyers on contractual safeguards and regulatory expectations.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court's interim order in Ranganathan Madhavan v G Filmz Studioz & Ors marks a landmark moment for personality rights, artificial intelligence, and platform liability in India. This ruling decisively reaffirms an individual's sovereign control over the commercial and moral value of their face and voice in the era of synthetic media.</p>\n\n<p>Actor R. Madhavan sued multiple defendants, including platforms like Meta and Google, for unauthorized exploitation of his name, image, likeness, and voice. These personal attributes, asserted as distinctive identifiers and valuable commercial assets, were used in AI-generated deepfakes, morphed pornographic content, and unauthorized merchandise. Platforms were included to facilitate enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>The court established Madhavan's persona as both a proprietary and dignitary interest, rooted in constitutional Articles 19 and 21, performers' moral rights under the Copyright Act, and common law. It protects these rights from unauthorized commercial gain and recognizes that obscene deepfakes infringe upon dignity.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, the court distinguished AI-generated commercial exploitation from legitimate expressive uses. It ruled that AI-enabled personality cloning for deceptive advertising or pornographic content falls squarely outside fair dealing or free speech protections, considering AI an exacerbating factor in such infringements.</p>\n\n<p>The comprehensive interim relief restrains all identified and unknown infringers from using Madhavan's persona via any technology, including AI. A multi-layered enforcement strategy mandates video platforms to remove content, domain registrars to suspend infringing websites, merchandising platforms to delist products, and social media platforms to effect takedowns and disclose infringer details. This strategy assigns compliance costs to intermediaries and aids in identifying anonymous infringers.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment integrates personality rights as a robust economic interest, akin to a trademark, while firmly linking it to constitutional dignity. It offers a hybrid of property, privacy, and anti-defamation norms, establishing a technologically aware, commercially grounded, and constitutionally infused model for personality rights in India, setting a significant precedent for the digital self.</p>",

This follows the May 2025 update to CIRP forms and a temporary late fee exemption until December 31, 2025. The new circular operationalizes an OTP-authenticated \"Modification Utility\" on the IBBI portal, enabling Insolvency Professionals (IPs) to self-correct errors in previously filed forms without resorting to formal amendment routes. Corrections made before a form's statutory due date incur no penalty. However, modifications submitted after the due date are treated as new, delayed submissions, incurring a fee.</p>\n\n<p>Concurrently, the circular reactivates delayed filing levies from January 1, 2026, lifting the earlier suspension. For any form whose due date fell on or before December 31, 2025, but is ultimately submitted (whether original, corrected, or updated) on or after January 1, 2026, IPs must pay ₹500 per form per month of delay, exclusive of GST. This fee is automatically computed and collected electronically. An IP correcting a timely 2025 filing in 2026 will pay this fee, which attaches to the calendar month of the eventual re-upload. This regime combines procedural facilitation with economic deterrence, incentivizing early rectification and ensuring both accuracy and punctuality in CIRP filings.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court, in Mahesh Kumar Agarwal v. Union of India, affirmed that pending criminal proceedings do not automatically lead to passport denial, underscoring the right to travel abroad as an intrinsic aspect of Article 21 personal liberty. This ruling clarifies that while the Passports Act, 1967, permits regulation, statutory restrictions must operate within defined legal and constitutional limits.</p>\n\n<p>The appellant, facing multiple criminal cases and a suspended sentence, secured permissions from trial courts for passport renewal, with conditions restricting foreign travel without prior judicial approval. However, the Regional Passport Office refused normal renewal, citing Section 6(2)(f) of the Act and demanding specific court permission for foreign travel for a defined period. This decision was upheld by the High Court, prompting an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court comprehensively interpreted the Passports Act, harmonizing Section 6(2)(f) (mandating refusal during criminal proceedings) with Section 22, which enables the Central Government to grant exemptions. It emphasized the full effect of Notification GSR 570(E) of 1993, providing a conditional exemption for such persons, subject to court permission and necessary safeguards.</p>\n\n<p>The Court ruled that indefinite denial of passport renewal, particularly when criminal courts have already imposed safeguards to ensure the accused's presence, constitutes a disproportionate restriction under Article 21. It mandated administrative authorities to respect judicial permissions granted by competent courts. This judgment prevents procedural safeguards from becoming permanent disabilities, upholding judicial oversight and constitutional guarantees against rigid application of statutory provisions.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, in Amit Chaurasia v. ICICI Bank Limited (December 2025), strongly affirmed party autonomy in online dispute resolution (ODR) arbitration while also encouraging consensual settlement. The case involved a borrower challenging a credit facility's ODR clause, which specified dispute resolution through the bank's Online Dispute Resolution Agency (ODRA) via a two-step process: mandatory conciliation followed by arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioner argued that there was no consensus on the arbitrator's identity and that the ODRA lacked statutory independence. However, the Court held that the petitioner's acceptance of the facility after receiving notice of the web-linked terms and conditions, coupled with a failure to object to ODRA intimations, constituted implied acceptance under Section 7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. It further clarified that a pre-named institutional arbitrator, chosen contractually by parties, is not inherently biased or indicative of a lack of consent.</p>\n\n<p>Despite rejecting the challenge to the arbitration agreement, the Court, recognizing the modest monetary stakes and both parties' openness to settle, exercised its inherent powers to direct them to mediation. This ruling sends a clear message: courts will uphold commercial contracts incorporating institutionalized dispute resolution mechanisms, yet simultaneously facilitate negotiated resolutions when parties are amenable, demonstrating that party autonomy and access to justice can coexist effectively.</p>",

The Court held such questions fall under Section 16 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, limiting judicial scrutiny under Section 11(6) to merely confirming the prima facie existence of an arbitration agreement.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from an APGENCO EPC tender, where Tecpro, a consortium member, unilaterally invoked arbitration after entering Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). Appellants APGENCO and VA Tech argued the arbitration agreement mandated collective invocation, citing Tecpro's insolvency and leadership change. Tecpro countered that the consortium wasn't a juristic person and its agreement allowed individual representation upon insolvency.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court underscored the policy of minimal judicial intervention, clarifying that the appellants conflated the \"existence\" of an arbitration agreement with Tecpro's \"entitlement\" or \"capacity\" to invoke it individually. Substantive issues, including consortium survival, consent requirements, and liquidation impact, are exclusively for the arbitral tribunal. The Court dismissed the appeals, upholding the High Court's tribunal appointment and remitting all substantive objections to the arbitrator under Section 16, reinforcing the principle of kompetenz-kompetenz.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court's judgment in Harshbir Singh Pannu v. Jaswinder Singh critically examines how \"termination of arbitral proceedings\" has been weaponized in India. The Court's deep dive, tracing from the UNCITRAL Model Law to international institutional rules (SIAC, LCIA, HKIAC), reveals how India's fragmented statutory provisions in Sections 25, 30, 32, and 38 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, undermine the arbitral process.</p>\n\n<p>The case, stemming from a hospital partnership dispute, highlighted how fee recalibrations post-counterclaim, and subsequent termination orders under Section 38 for non-payment, can act as a \"procedural guillotine,\" effectively extinguishing valid claims without a merits adjudication. Unlike the clear, consolidated termination frameworks of international institutions, India's Act creates a fog of uncertainty regarding the tribunal's mandate and parties' recourse, diverging from UNCITRAL's intent for carefully delimited termination scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing these systemic flaws, the Supreme Court, while partially vindicating the appellant, provided \"meaningful suggestions\" for legislative reform. The article argues the forthcoming Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, 2024, must: consolidate termination grounds into a single, comprehensive provision; establish a transparent, \"terms of reference\"-driven fee and deposit regime; and create an express statutory remedy against capricious termination orders.</p>\n\n<p>These reforms, supported by similar critiques in ASF Buildtech (jurisdiction) and Gayatri Balasamy (post-award control), are crucial to transform termination from a weapon into a calibrated safeguard. The Bill's success in translating these lessons will determine whether Indian arbitration achieves parity with leading global forums.</p>",

Addressing long-standing concerns regarding a lack of legal oversight, inconsistent standards, and unchecked private certification practices, the Bill seeks to bring these under a statutory, government-controlled framework.</p>\n\n<p>The legislation expands the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)'s mandate, empowering it to regulate, grant, and monitor religious dietary certifications exclusively through government-notified agencies under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Crucially, the Bill prohibits private organizations, trusts, or societies from issuing Halal certifications or collecting associated fees, centralizing this authority with designated government agencies and directing all fees to the Consolidated Fund of India. The scope of such certifications is strictly limited to food products for human consumption, with stringent penalties for contravention.</p>\n\n<p>A dedicated Committee on Certification of Religious Dietary Food Items is established to formulate and periodically update uniform national standards for all forms of religious dietary certifications, encompassing Halal, Kosher, and Jhatka. This committee ensures a balanced approach incorporating scientific expertise and inter-ministerial coordination, covering aspects like slaughter, processing, packaging, and labelling.

    "description": "<p>The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), enacted to safeguard homebuyers, has seen its authority significantly fortified by recent judicial interventions. These rulings have consistently prioritized allottee rights, challenging contractual loopholes and traditional financial claims.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, developers attempted to bypass RERA by structuring transactions as long-term \"leases\" (e.g., 999 years) rather than sales, claiming their customers were merely \"lessees\" outside RERA's purview. In Lavasa Corporation Ltd. vs. Jitendra Jagdish Tulsiani, courts applied the \"substance over form\" principle. They ruled that such agreements, involving substantial upfront \"premiums\" and minimal \"rent,\" were essentially sales, thereby confirming buyers as \"allottees\" under RERA and closing this potential loophole.</p>\n\n<p>A more profound challenge emerged from the conflict between homebuyers and banks. Banks, as \"secured creditors\" under the SARFAESI Act, would seize projects upon developer default, often leaving allottees who had paid for their units with no recourse. The Supreme Court, in Union Bank of India vs. Rajasthan RERA, delivered a landmark decision. It held that when a bank takes control of a RERA-registered project, it becomes a \"statutory assignee\" and therefore a \"promoter\" under RERA, assuming the original developer's liabilities to allottees. This decision effectively elevated RERA-secured homebuyer rights above SARFAESI-secured lenders' recovery rights, compelling banks to become de facto monitors of project compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Further strengthening allottee protection, the judiciary addressed conflicts with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). In Vishal Chelani v. Debashis Nanda, the Supreme Court rejected attempts to \"hyper-classify\" allottees, ensuring those seeking RERA refunds maintained their status as \"financial creditors\" under the IBC with equal priority. The Mansi Brar Fernandes v. Shubha Sharma ruling clarified that IBC protections are for \"genuine homebuyers\" seeking shelter, not speculative investors using assured return schemes. Crucially, this judgment also elevated the right to housing to a \"fundamental right\" derived from Article 21 of the Constitution, providing a robust constitutional foundation for allottee protection and advocating for \"project-by-project\" insolvency.</p>\n\n<p>These judicial interventions have profoundly redefined the homebuyer's status, transforming them from a mere contractual party to a beneficiary of a constitutionally protected \"fundamental right\" and a robust \"financial creditor\" in insolvency. This shift has imposed significant accountability on developers and financial institutions, fostering a more transparent and allottee-centric real estate ecosystem.</p>",

Ltd., significantly clarified the limits of an arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction, particularly regarding the doctrines of lifting the corporate veil and alter ego, and the assessment of damages. The Court reaffirmed that arbitral awards must strictly adhere to the contractual framework and cannot extend obligations beyond the arbitration agreement.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) where Sugesan Transport advanced ₹2.50 crores to E.C. Bose for a performance bank guarantee. E.C. Bose failed to repay the amount. During arbitration, E.C. Bose counter-claimed ₹75 crores, alleging a joint venture for a KOPT contract and Sugesan's failure to supply equipment. The Arbitrator partially accepted both claims, directing repayment of ₹2.50 crores to Sugesan but also awarding ₹6.51 crores as damages to E.C. Bose, imputing equipment supply obligations to Sugesan based on documents signed by a third entity (Collate Consultants Pvt. Ltd.) and applying the ‘alter ego’ doctrine.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court held that an arbitral tribunal is a creature of contract and cannot extend liability to non-signatories or pierce the corporate veil; these powers are exclusive to courts. It found the Arbitrator's reliance on Collate Consultants' documents to impose obligations on Sugesan without jurisdiction. The Court further noted that the NCLAT and Supreme Court had already ruled the MoU was a standalone financial transaction, independent of any equipment supply obligations. Regarding damages, the Court stressed that under Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act, damages must be proven with actual loss and evidentiary basis, not speculative assumptions like the mere encashment of a bank guarantee.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the High Court partially set aside the arbitral award. It upheld the direction for E.C. Bose to repay ₹2.50 crores to Sugesan Transport but entirely eliminated the counter-claim award of ₹6.51 crores in favour of E.C. Bose, deeming it unsustainable. This judgment reinforces that arbitral tribunals must operate strictly within the arbitration agreement's contours, cannot apply doctrines like 'alter ego' to non-signatories, and damages must be strictly proven.</p>",
