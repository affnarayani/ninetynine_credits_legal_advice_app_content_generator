    "title": "Bombay High Court Upholds Mother\u2019s Right To Custody After Father\u2019s Death",
    "description": "<p>The Bombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench, in *Parvati Swati v. Vyankat & Anr.*, reaffirmed a mother's right to custody following the father's death, emphasizing the paramount importance of the child's welfare under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. The ruling underscores that while grandparents can provide love, the mother, as the natural guardian, holds the inherent right and responsibility unless proven unfit.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose after the father's death, where the paternal grandparents sought guardianship of the minor child, whose custody had been granted to the father in a prior divorce decree. The mother filed a counter-application seeking custody, which was initially rejected. The High Court addressed whether the grandparents could claim custody in preference to the mother, citing Section 6(a) of the Act, which favors the mother as the natural guardian after the father's death, especially for children below five.</p>\n\n<p>The Court considered arguments from both sides, including the mother's improved financial stability and the child's established relationship with the grandparents. Justice Chapalgaonkar, reiterating the child's welfare as paramount, ruled in favor of the mother, citing precedents that a natural parent's custody should only be denied if they are demonstrably unfit. The Court granted custody to the mother while providing visitation rights to the grandparents, balancing the child's legal right to maternal care with the importance of maintaining family bonds. This judgment reaffirms the principle that a mother's care is irreplaceable while emphasizing the need for compassion and justice in guardianship law.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has released the Draft Reserve Bank of India (Lending to Related Parties) Directions, 2025, seeking public input by October 31, 2025. This draft aims to establish a unified, principle-based framework for transactions between regulated entities (REs) and their related parties, an area of long-standing concern regarding governance and prudential oversight.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, regulations on lending to related parties are fragmented across various regulatory frameworks, leading to potential arbitrage and ambiguity. The new draft directions intend to harmonize governance standards, enhance transparency in related-party exposures, and strengthen market discipline across all REs, including banks, NBFCs, and cooperative banks.</p>\n\n<p>Key provisions include a broad definition of \"related parties\" aligned with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS 24), materiality-based thresholds for Board or committee approval of transactions, and a principle-based exemption to Section 20(1)(b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The draft also mandates comprehensive reporting and disclosure obligations to align with international best practices.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed framework emphasizes ethical governance and conflict of interest management, requiring financial institutions to embed robust governance and risk management practices. Non-compliance may lead to regulatory action and reputational consequences. This initiative, part of broader reforms promoting uniformity and sound corporate governance, follows the Final Co-Lending Framework. The RBI invites stakeholder feedback before finalizing the directions, which will supersede existing circulars.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Draft Lending to Related Parties Directions, 2025, represent a crucial step toward promoting integrity, transparency, and uniform governance in India's financial system, balancing operational flexibility with prudential discipline to enhance resilience and credibility.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Allahabad High Court, in *Suresh Chandra Singh Negi and Another v. Bank of Baroda and Others*, addressed the liability of banks in cases of alleged unauthorized electronic transactions, specifically when the customer's credentials and devices were used. The court examined the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s 2017 Circular on customer protection and clarified the extent of customer and bank liability in digital banking operations.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved petitioners claiming unauthorized transfers from their accounts despite using internet banking facilities. They argued cyber fraud, citing a blocked SIM card preventing OTP receipt, and relied on the RBI circular mandating banks to restore debited amounts if notified within three days. The Bank of Baroda, however, presented evidence showing the transactions were initiated by the petitioners themselves using their login credentials, registered devices, and OTPs, with a password change following the transfers.</p>\n\n<p>The Allahabad High Court found that the evidence indicated the transactions were carried out by the petitioners, noting the use of their login, OTPs, and the addition of beneficiaries. The court also highlighted the delay in reporting the issue as inconsistent with genuine cyber fraud victims. Analysis of the RBI circular revealed that while the bank bears the burden of proof, the Bank of Baroda successfully demonstrated customer liability. The court also distinguished precedents cited by the petitioners, noting that those cases involved third-party fraud and prompt reporting, unlike the present case.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the court ruled there was no unauthorized withdrawal and dismissed the petition, emphasizing that the RBI circular protects genuine cyber fraud victims, not those attempting to escape consequences of their own negligence. The decision reinforces that digital vigilance is a shared responsibility, and liability cannot be shifted to the bank when transactions are executed using the customer\u2019s own credentials.</p>",

Mukesh Bansilal Shah & Ors.*, levied exemplary costs of \u20b925,00,000 on Auto Credit Corporation and Rekha Prakash Jain for abusing judicial proceedings and obstructing justice. Justice Kamal Khata's judgment emphasizes the limits of locus standi in testamentary matters and aims to deter manipulation of probate proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from the applicants' attempt to intervene in a testamentary suit, claiming tenancy rights to a property under the administration of Mr. Ketan Trivedi. They sought to remove the seal on the premises, alleging unauthorized sealing and continuous possession since 1991. The applicants relied on dismissed eviction suits and pending civil revision applications to support their claim.</p>\n\n<p>The Administrator countered that the premises were locked, the applicants lacked valid tenancy proof, and they had tampered with the seal. The Court found the Chamber Summons misconceived, noting that tenancy issues fall under the Small Causes Court's jurisdiction, not the Probate Court. Citing *Dnyandeo Sabaji Naik v. Pradnya Prakash Khadekar*, the Court emphasized the need to prevent misuse of the legal system and imposed exemplary costs to deter frivolous litigation.</p>\n\n<p>The Court dismissed the Chamber Summons, directing payment to the Armed Forces Battle Casualties Welfare Fund and issuing a show-cause notice for contempt proceedings regarding tampering with sealed premises. Failure to pay would result in property attachment. This ruling affirms judicial intolerance toward procedural abuse and underscores the importance of respecting judicial orders and estate administration.</p>",

Ltd. guilty of deficiency in service for demanding additional, unjustified payments for Service Tax and GST and wrongfully canceling a flat allotment of Mr. Rajeev Menon and others. The Commission directed the builder to hand over possession of the flat within two months and provide compensation for mental agony and litigation expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated when the complainants, having paid 95% of the total sale consideration for a flat in \u201cThe Jewel of Noida,\u201d received a demand for an additional \u20b915,25,120 towards Service Tax and GST, which was not indicated in the original agreement. When they objected, the builder canceled the allotment. The Commission examined whether the complainants were consumers and whether the builder's actions constituted a deficiency in service.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission determined that the complainants were indeed consumers, as the builder failed to prove any commercial intent behind their purchase. It also found the builder's demand for additional taxes to be without legal or contractual basis, constituting a deficiency in service and an unfair trade practice. The order reaffirms that builders cannot impose arbitrary financial demands retroactively, especially when not stipulated in the initial agreement and that contractual terms must be upheld in fairness to the buyer.</p>",

    "title": "Understanding TRAI\u2019s UCC Rules: Compliance Insights For Corporates",
    "description": "<p>The National Commodity Clearing Limited (NCCL) has issued a circular directing members to comply with the amended Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). This underscores the importance of protecting consumers from Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC) and the responsibilities of corporations in managing mass communications.</p>\n\n<p>The TCCCPR, grounded in the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997, aims to regulate commercial communications and empower consumers to control the messages they receive. Recent amendments prohibit the use of standard 10-digit mobile numbers for commercial communications, mandating the use of designated 1600-series numbers for transactional and service-related messages to enhance traceability and oversight.</p>\n\n<p>NCCL's circular emphasizes the need for corporates to whitelist URLs, mobile applications, and digital assets used in communications, as well as ensuring that SIP/PRI connections comply with TCCCPR standards. Cooperation with the Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) and TRAI is also crucial, requiring companies to report and respond to advisories, integrating cybersecurity, consumer protection, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Non-compliance can lead to monetary penalties, blocked communication channels, and restrictions on services, as well as potential liabilities under the Information Technology Act, 2000, related to unauthorized access and cyber fraud. Reputational risks and loss of customer trust are also significant concerns. Therefore, corporate legal and compliance teams must integrate TCCCPR compliance into standard operating procedures, including regular audits, whitelisting tools, adherence to 1600-series numbers, and comprehensive staff training.</p>\n\n<p>The NCCL circular indicates a broader regulatory trend in India towards stricter consumer protection and digital security in corporate communications. By proactively aligning systems with TRAI's amendments, businesses can mitigate legal and operational risks, while strengthening consumer trust. Compliance must be a core component of operational strategy to protect consumers, uphold corporate integrity, and avoid regulatory and reputational fallout.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This case summary details a criminal writ petition filed by Ortho Relief Hospital and Research Centre against M/s. Anand Distilleries and its Directors, following the dishonoring of a cheque issued as security for a loan. The hospital had extended a loan to the company, receiving a post-dated cheque as security. After periodic interest payments ceased, the hospital learned of insolvency proceedings initiated against M/s. Anand Distilleries under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IB Code).</p>\n\n<p>Despite the insolvency proceedings, the respondents requested that the cheque be presented, which was subsequently dishonored due to insufficient funds. A legal notice was issued, followed by a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (NI Act), and Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The trial court discharged the respondents from the Section 138 NI Act offense, citing the ongoing insolvency proceedings, leading to the hospital challenging this discharge order in the Bombay High Court.</p>\n\n<p>The central issue before the High Court was whether the initiation of insolvency proceedings under the IB Code prior to the filing of a complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act nullifies the latter proceedings. The Bombay High Court, referencing relevant Supreme Court judgments, ruled that the trial court had erred in discharging the respondents. The court emphasized that the moratorium for corporate debtors under the IB Code does not extend to the personal criminal liability of directors and individuals under the NI Act. Consequently, the High Court allowed the Criminal Writ Petition, quashing the trial court's orders and reinstating the complaint, reinforcing the principle that personal penal liability persists despite corporate insolvency proceedings.</p>",

This notification provides a clear legal and operational framework for settling foreign currency transactions within the IFSC. This enhancement provides regulatory clarity, risk management, and operational efficiency for market participants.</p>\n\n<p>The FCSS is established under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007, with IFSCA authorizing CCIL IFSC Limited (CIL) to operate the payment system. IFSCA also notified CIL's bye-laws, rules, and regulations, making them legally binding. The framework aligns with the International Financial Services Centres Authority Act, 2019, empowering IFSCA to regulate payment systems within IFSCs. The International Financial Services Centres Authority (Payment and Settlement Systems) Regulations, 2024, provide specific operational guidance, solidifying the FCSS as a regulated settlement system in GIFT IFSC.</p>\n\n<p>The formalization of FCSS strengthens GIFT IFSC's infrastructure, enhancing its attractiveness to international financial institutions. By providing a domestic, regulated foreign currency settlement platform, the FCSS reduces dependence on offshore systems, enhancing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This will provide international banks, corporates, and financial institutions operating in GIFT IFSC with regulatory certainty, improved risk mitigation, and compliance clarity.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the IFSCA's notification codifies the legal and operational framework for foreign currency settlements in GIFT IFSC, laying a foundation for secure, efficient, and compliant cross-border transactions.

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) in its dispute with Essar Power Limited (EPL) regarding the diversion of electricity to Essar Steel Limited (ESL) under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The case, stemming from a 1996 agreement for EPL to supply electricity to both GUVNL and ESL, centered on EPL's alleged breach of proportionate allocation by supplying more power to ESL than agreed, leading to claims of wrongful diversion.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute moved through multiple adjudicative bodies, including the Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) and the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL). Previous rulings had addressed issues such as capacity declaration, compensation for diversion, and the appropriate methodology for computing the diverted electricity. The Supreme Court's intervention became necessary to settle the matter.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of adhering to its 2016 decision, which established the proportionate allocation obligation and capacity declaration requirement under the PPA. A key aspect of the judgment was the entitlement of GUVNL to reimbursement of fixed charges for electricity diverted to ESL, distinct from compensation for diversion. The court also upheld the GERC's methodology for computing electricity diversion, using hourly periods until February 23, 2005, and half-hourly periods thereafter, acknowledging a subsequent consensual change implemented by both parties. Additionally, the court affirmed the method of calculating compensation for wrongful diversion, which is based on the HTP-1 Tariff Energy Charge rate reduced by variable costs. The Supreme Court upheld APTEL's decision to remand specific issues, such as discrepancies in Deemed Generation Incentive amounts, to GERC for further factual examination and determination. The ruling directed GUVNL to receive reimbursement of fixed charges and compensation for wrongful diversion, following the specified computation methodologies, and instructed each party to bear its own costs.</p>",

This ruling sets a precedent in India's jurisprudence on deepfakes, AI exploitation, and publicity rights by acknowledging the legal protection of a celebrity's persona, extending to voice cloning, AI-generated content, and digital merchandise.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from the misappropriation of Asha Bhosle's voice, name, image, and likeness without her consent. AI platforms were developing tools to clone her voice, allowing users to generate songs in her style, which were then circulated on platforms like YouTube. Additionally, online marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart were selling unauthorized merchandise featuring her image. Bhosle argued these actions violated her personality rights and moral rights under Section 38-B of the Copyright Act, 1957.</p>\n\n<p>The Bombay High Court concluded that Bhosle had established a strong prima facie case, emphasizing the unauthorized technological exploitation of her identity and reputation.

The central issue concerned a wife and minor daughter seeking maintenance from a husband who was a minor at the time of the application but attained majority during the proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>The Family Court initially granted the maintenance, but the husband challenged the order, citing his minority at the time of filing. The High Court, however, clarified that while maintenance liability could not arise before the husband's majority, it became applicable upon attaining majority. The court considered evidence of cruelty and neglect by the husband, justifying the wife's refusal to cohabit. Assessing the husband's income based on his labor capacity within a joint Hindu family, the court deemed the initial maintenance amount excessive, referencing Supreme Court precedents such as Rajnesh vs. Neha.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the High Court partly allowed the revision, reducing the maintenance amount to Rs. 2,500 for the wife and Rs. 2,000 for the daughter, effective from the date the husband attained majority, aligning the allowance with approximately 25% of the assessed income. This judgment underscores that maintenance claims can be sustained despite the husband's initial minority, emphasizing substantive justice, responsibility, and the protection of vulnerable spouses and children. It clarifies that minority does not permanently exempt individuals from future liability when cruelty and neglect are established.</p>",

The court cautioned against welfare schemes being exploited for private enrichment, labeling the practice a \"usual modus operandi to siphon off valuable public lands.\"</p>\n\n<p>The judgment carries significant implications for governance, urban policy, and constitutional accountability, reinforcing that the State functions as a trustee of public land and must ensure that any transfer demonstrably serves public interest. The court underscored the necessity of obtaining high-level sanction, maintaining transparency, and ensuring public consultation before implementing such large-scale redevelopment schemes. The absence of transparency or due process, the Court cautioned, makes such projects vulnerable to judicial invalidation. The decision calls for a balanced approach between welfare and public interest.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the Bombay High Court's remarks serve as a reminder that public assets cannot be disposed of without clear justification, transparency, and constitutional compliance, reinforcing the need for procedural integrity, executive accountability, and transparent governance.</p>",

This notification clarifies the existing provision in the Maharashtra Shops and Establishments (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 2017, Section 16(1)(b), that allows businesses to operate seven days a week, provided each employee receives a continuous 24-hour weekly rest period. Establishments serving alcohol are excluded.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, while technically permitted, businesses hesitated due to ambiguity and concerns regarding compliance checks. The notification explicitly allows continuous operations under the condition of mandatory weekly rest, balancing commercial interests with employee protection. This clarity removes legal uncertainty, enabling businesses to confidently plan seven-day operations while adhering to labor laws, minimum wage regulations, and occupational safety standards.</p>\n\n<p>This progressive step by the Maharashtra government modernizes business operations while safeguarding worker rights. It confirms the permissibility of continuous operations with statutory safeguards, aligning the state with global business practices and reinforcing the importance of employee welfare. This landmark development creates a flexible, responsible commercial ecosystem, empowering businesses to extend hours, improve service, and strategically plan operations, provided they remain vigilant about compliance.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In September 2025, the Delhi High Court concluded a protracted matrimonial dispute originating from a 2006 divorce petition filed in Mumbai. The central issues revolved around the wife's entitlement to half of a \u20b91.09 crore surplus from an auctioned flat, the appropriateness of \u20b92 lakh monthly interim maintenance, and the husband's plea for divorce based on cruelty and desertion. The court's 35-page judgment upheld established family law principles and underscored the continued relevance of fault in Hindu matrimonial law.</p>\n\n<p>The couple married in 1999 and lived in Mumbai due to the husband's job. After the husband left in 2006, the wife moved to Delhi. The husband filed for divorce, which was transferred to Delhi, triggering parallel litigation over maintenance and property rights. A flat purchased jointly during the marriage was auctioned due to default, resulting in the surplus now in dispute. The wife claimed entitlement to half the surplus and contested the interim maintenance amount, while the husband sought to overturn both.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court addressed four appeals collectively. The husband alleged cruelty and desertion based on various incidents, while the wife countered with claims of the husband's relationship with a colleague. The court considered several legal precedents regarding maintenance, cruelty, desertion, and the bar created by Section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA). It also invoked the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act.</p>\n\n<p>The court affirmed the \u20b92 lakh monthly maintenance, citing the wife's lack of independent income and the husband's financial capacity. It ruled that the wife was entitled to 50% of the flat's surplus, emphasizing that jointly-owned property is presumed to be held equally unless proven otherwise, and that the Benami Act prevents the husband from claiming sole ownership based on EMI payments. On the divorce petition, the court concurred with the Family Court that the husband did not demonstrate adequate cause for divorce, and the husband's own misconduct barred him from obtaining a decree. The court directed the release of \u20b954.5 lakh to the wife, maintained the maintenance amount, and dismissed the divorce appeal, highlighting the importance of fault and clean hands in Indian matrimonial law and reminding litigants that conduct during and after filing for divorce is relevant.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has ruled that Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) contributions collected by an employer do not become the property of the corporate debtor and must be excluded from the liquidation estate. This decision, delivered on September 24, 2025, in Company Appeal (AT)(Ins) No. 301 of 2024, overturns a prior NCLT order and directs that Rs 1,20,80,940 of ESI dues belonging to Gupta Dyeing & Printing Mills Pvt. Ltd. be kept separate from the assets available to other creditors during liquidation.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose when the Regional Director of ESIC claimed that unpaid ESI contributions, deducted from workers' wages, should be excluded from the company's assets due to a statutory trust under Section 40(4) of the ESI Act, 1948. This claim was challenged by the liquidator and other creditors who would benefit from including the amount in the liquidation estate. The NCLT initially dismissed the ESIC plea, deeming the Corporation an operational creditor without priority under Section 53(1)(b) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).</p>\n\n<p>On appeal, the NCLAT emphasized that employers hold employee ESI contributions as trustees for the ESIC, making non-payment a breach of trust. The tribunal aligned with a previous ruling in Nurani Subramanian Suryanarayanan, Liquidator of M/s Care IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd. v. ESIC, which resolved a similar issue in favor of the Corporation. The NCLAT clarified that Section 36(4)(a)(i) of the IBC carves out \"assets in trust for any third party\" from the liquidation estate, and Section 40(4) of the ESI Act creates precisely such a trust.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT set aside the NCLT order, directing that the ESI dues of Rs 1,20,80,940 be remitted to the ESIC and not treated as part of the liquidation estate. The ruling affirms that social security deductions are distinct and do not merge into the corporate debtor's assets. This decision serves as a reminder to liquidators and reinforces the right of statutory authorities to insist on exclusion rather than mere priority of such deductions. This precedent may influence similar claims related to other wage-related statutes like provident fund and gratuity.</p>",

These directions consolidate and standardize procedures for settling claims related to deposit accounts, safe deposit lockers, and articles in safe custody for deceased bank customers, aiming to minimize delays and ensure uniform practices across commercial and cooperative banks. They do not apply to government-administered savings schemes like PPF or SCSS.</p>\n\n<p>The legal basis for these directions rests on provisions intended to expedite claim settlements. The RBI observed inconsistent bank practices regarding nomination, often requiring succession certificates even with existing nominations. These directions repeal prior circulars, establishing a uniform and enforceable system.</p>\n\n<p>For claims exceeding a specified threshold, settlement necessitates succession certificates, legal heir certificates, or affidavits, potentially with sureties. Banks retain discretion to act on uncontested Wills without requiring probate but require court orders for disputed claims. In the absence of a nomination, a simplified procedure involves claim forms, death certificates, identity proof, and a legal heir certificate or affidavit with no-objection statements from other heirs. Disputed cases without nomination require probate, succession certificate, or a court order for resolution.</p>\n\n<p>These Directions represent a significant reform in banking consumer protection law, establishing uniform procedures, timelines, and penalties for delays. They address long-standing grievances by depositor families, ensuring efficient access to funds and belongings while balancing ease of settlement with safeguards against wrongful claims. The harmonized framework enhances operational clarity for banks and strengthens customer trust in the banking system.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In Sharad Singh v. H. D. Narang, the Supreme Court of India delivered a landmark judgment enhancing the compensation awarded to the legal representative of a deceased accident victim, Sharad Singh, who suffered paraplegia due to a motor vehicle accident. The ruling, authored by Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice N.V. Anjaria, refines motor accident compensation jurisprudence, particularly concerning students with demonstrated academic potential.</p>\n\n<p>The victim, a 20-year-old B. Com student and ICAI enrollee, sustained severe injuries in 2001 when a negligently driven car struck the motorcycle he was riding, resulting in complete paraplegia. He remained bedridden until his death in 2021. The Supreme Court addressed the High Court's inadequate assessment of income and future medical expenses. It dismissed the insurance company's objections to medical bills from hospitals outside the victim's hometown, emphasizing the company's national presence and the legitimate need for specialized care in different locations.  The Court upheld medical expenses amounting to Rs. 20 lakhs, recognizing the necessity of the treatments for sustaining the victim's life.</p>\n\n<p>Critically, the Court rejected the lower courts' reliance on minimum wage as the basis for calculating loss of income. The Supreme Court deemed the use of minimum wage inappropriate for a graduate student pursuing a Chartered Accountancy qualification. Instead, it estimated a notional monthly income of Rs. 5,000 in 2001, considering his potential as an accountant, and applied a 40% increase for future prospects, consistent with National Insurance Company Limited vs. Pranay Sethi and Others. This led to a revised loss of income calculation of Rs. 15,12,000.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's judgment resulted in a significantly enhanced total compensation award of Rs. 40,34,356. The Court underscored the importance of considering a student's potential when determining compensation and reiterated that insurance companies cannot evade liability on unsubstantiated grounds, especially when life-saving medical care is involved. The ruling serves as a precedent for equitable compensation, acknowledging both the victim's potential and the substantial costs associated with life-sustaining care.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Kerala High Court, in a judgment delivered on September 22, 2025, addressed the issue of whether a settlement reached at a Lok Adalat precludes a subsequent claim for compensation under the Employees\u2019 Compensation Act, 1923, and whether Section 8(1) of the Act prohibits payments not deposited with the Commissioner. The case involved parents who, after their son's death in a workplace accident, received Rs 10 lakh through a Lok Adalat settlement and later sought additional compensation from the Employees\u2019 Compensation Commissioner.</p>\n\n<p>The Commissioner denied the claim, citing the prior Lok Adalat award as a final discharge of liability. The parents appealed this decision, leading the High Court to formulate two substantial questions of law: whether the Employees\u2019 Compensation Act claim can be settled through a Pre-Litigation Petition despite Section 8(1) of the EC Act, and whether receipt of money from the Lok Adalat bars a subsequent claim for the statutory amount before the Commissioner.</p>\n\n<p>The Court, referencing the supremacy clause in Section 25 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, ruled that the Lok Adalat settlement was final. It reasoned that when a dispute is taken to a Permanent Lok Adalat, the restrictions of Section 8(1) are relaxed, given the Adalat's role in protecting weaker parties. The court also invoked the doctrine of election of remedies, stating that the parents, having chosen to settle at the Lok Adalat, were bound by that choice. Thus, the appeal was dismissed, affirming that the Rs 10 lakh already received constituted a full and conclusive settlement, preventing the family from pursuing further compensation through the Employees\u2019 Compensation Commissioner.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) appeal, reinstating its order against the Kerala Film Exhibitors Federation (KFEF) for anti-competitive conduct under Section 3 of the Competition Act. The court ruled that the CCI's initial notice, forwarding the Director General's (DG) report and inviting replies and a hearing, adequately complied with the Act. It held that a separate show-cause notice dedicated solely to the penalty was not required under the statutory scheme.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a complaint alleging KFEF organized a boycott preventing distributors from dealing with a specific theater. The CCI, based on the DG's report, found KFEF in violation and imposed monetary penalties and behavioral directions on the federation and its office-bearers. The COMPAT (Competition Appellate Tribunal) upheld the violation finding but overturned penalties against the office-bearers, arguing the lack of a separate penalty notice.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court addressed whether a second, separate show-cause notice specifically proposing penalties is required before imposing sanctions under the Act. The Court emphasized that the Competition Act necessitates timely and effective adjudication, with a single hearing offering a full opportunity to address both findings and potential sanctions. The Court found that the initial notice sufficiently identified the contraventions, named the individuals involved, sought financial information, and scheduled a hearing, satisfying the requirements of natural justice. Furthermore, the Court highlighted that Section 48 of the Act deems individuals in charge responsible for contraventions, negating the need for separate notification of liability. The Supreme Court restored the CCI's original order in full, also noting the importance of the DG report stage and the need to address all factual and mitigation points at that hearing.</p>",

It also clarified the extinguishment of pre-CIRP claims upon resolution plan approval.</p>\n\n<p>Key rulings include the acceptance of promoters as \"persons aggrieved\" with caveats regarding obstructive behavior, the clarification that the CoC remains active until plan implementation or liquidation, and the rejection of clauses allowing indefinite extension of implementation. The court also ruled that EBITDA earned during CIRP remains with the corporate debtor unless the resolution plan specifies otherwise, and reaffirmed that pre-CIRP claims are extinguished upon plan approval under Section 31 of the IBC.

This initiative, outlined in a \"MOST URGENT\" circular, instructs all States and Union Territories to conduct intensive surveillance and enforcement activities.</p>\n\n<p>The timing of this drive is crucial, as demand for these food items increases significantly (40-60%) during festivals like Navaratri, Durga Puja, Dussehra, Karva Chauth, and Diwali. This surge in demand can create opportunities for adulteration due to the price difference between genuine and substandard ingredients.</p>\n\n<p>The FSSAI has outlined specific actions, including: micro-targeting high-risk areas such as sweet shop clusters, railway stations, and tourist hubs, equipped with rapid-test and laboratory sampling kits; deploying \"Food-Safety-on-Wheels\" mobile labs for on-the-spot testing and consumer awareness; and digitizing all inspection data (GPS location, photos, test results) into the FoSCoS portal or FoSCoRIS app for transparency and accountability. Data must be complete by November 15th to allow FSSAI to release a public scorecard before the wedding season.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the FSSAI aims to ensure consumer well-being and confidence in the safety and quality of food products during the festive season, preventing issues related to adulterated sweets and dairy products.</p>",

    "title": "Tribunal Deems Procedural Lapses Curable, Admits Insolvency Plea Against Corporate Debtor",
    "description": "<p>The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai Bench-II, admitted an insolvency petition filed by Pegasus Assets Reconstruction Pvt. Ltd. against Dee Plone Polyester Pvt. Ltd. under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), concerning a default exceeding \u20b937 crore. The ruling underscores the tribunal's stance that demonstrable debt and default should take precedence over procedural irregularities.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from loan facilities sanctioned by Dombivli Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd. (DNS Bank) to Dee Plone Polyester Pvt. Ltd., secured by hypothecation and mortgage deeds. After the Corporate Debtor defaulted, DNS Bank classified the loan as an NPA and subsequently assigned the debt to Pegasus Assets Reconstruction Pvt. Ltd. As of October 16, 2023, the default amounted to \u20b937.35 crore, which the Corporate Debtor acknowledged in audited financial statements and email correspondence.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLT concluded that procedural objections concerning stamping, registration, and authorization lapses were curable and did not invalidate the insolvency petition. It emphasized that acknowledgment of debt extends the limitation period and that the core focus under Section 7 of the IBC remains establishing the existence of financial debt and default. The tribunal dismissed allegations of malicious intent and reinforced the role of Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) in pursuing CIRP against defaulting borrowers. The decision reinforces the principle that the IBC is intended as a timely resolution mechanism focused on debt and default rather than being derailed by technical objections.</p>",

    "title": "BIS Issues Fresh Rules for Digital TV Receivers \u2013 26 Oct 2025 Deadline Looms",
    "description": "<p>The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has issued a circular effective 18 September 2025, mandating compliance with IS 18112:2025 \"Digital Television Receiver for Satellite Broadcast Transmission Specification (First Revision)\" for all plasma, LCD, and LED televisions sold in India. This is in addition to the existing safety standard IS 616:2017 / IEC 60065:2014, enforced under the Compulsory Registration Scheme (CRS). The deadline for compliance is 26 October 2025.</p>\n\n<p>The new regulation requires all television sets, both new and existing models, to incorporate a digital satellite receiver compliant with IS 18112 while continuing to meet the safety requirements of IS 616. A single R-number will now cover both standards, replacing separate satellite-only certifications. While labs can accept IS 18112:2022 test data until 30 December 2025, manufacturers must provide a notarized declaration committing to upgrade to the 2025 version.</p>\n\n<p>Existing safety-only licensees have until 25 September 2025 to submit inclusion requests with updated test reports. Those with models already containing evaluated satellite tuners can use an online module referencing the original IS 616 report. Non-compliant models will be removed from licenses after 26 October 2025, potentially leading to registration cancellation. Manufacturers using the 2022 standard have until 30 December 2025 to declare their transition to the 2025 version to avoid regulatory action. New applications are encouraged to directly pursue IS 18112:2025.</p>\n\n<p>After 26 October 2025, BIS will no longer grant new or expanded licenses without satellite receiver compliance. The standard mark has been simplified to include both \"IS 616 / IEC 60065\" and \"IS 18112\" with the common R-number. Customs officials, legal-metrology authorities, and e-commerce platforms have been alerted to the conjoined mark, with shipments bearing only the old IS 616 label potentially facing detention, fines, or re-export. IS 18112:2025 includes updated definitions, allows IS / IEC 62368-1 as an alternative safety standard, removes the power-consumption clause, adds testing guidance, and specifies a mute-to-unmute button on remote controls.</p>",

    "title": "\"Typo\" No Excuse: SC Quashes Complaint After Demand Notice Claims Double the Bounced Cheque",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India in Kaveri Plastics v. Mahdoom Bawa Bahrudeen Noorul ruled that a statutory demand notice seeking an amount that differs from the dishonored cheque's value is invalid, thus rendering a subsequent criminal complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, non-maintainable. The court emphasized a strict and technical interpretation of the law.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a dishonored cheque for Rs. 1,00,00,000/- issued by Kaveri Plastics to Mahdoom Bawa Bahrudeen Noorul. The subsequent demand notices incorrectly demanded Rs. 2,00,00,000/-, leading to the respondent's petition to quash the criminal complaint, which was ultimately upheld by the High Court. The Supreme Court addressed whether a demand notice survives when the amount claimed differs numerically from the dishonored cheque, even if the discrepancy is claimed to be inadvertent.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, asserting the necessity of a precise demand for \"the said amount of money\" as stipulated in Proviso (b) to Section 138. While a notice may include additional claims, the demand for the cheque amount must be accurate. The court found that demanding an inflated amount invalidated the notice and the associated complaint. The ruling reaffirms that meticulous adherence to the law is required for criminal prosecutions related to cheque dishonor, placing the onus on the complainant to ensure the demand notice is accurate, thereby providing the drawer with a clear and honest opportunity to settle the debt.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court on Medical Negligence: NCDRC Cannot Create a New Case Beyond Pleadings",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Deep Nursing Home and Another v. Manmeet Singh Mattewal and Others, clarified that adjudicatory forums cannot exceed the pleadings of the parties and invent a new case. The ruling emphasizes judicial discipline and clarifies the scope of liability in medical negligence cases. The court overturned the findings of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), which had held doctors and a nursing home liable.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from the death of Charanpreet Kaur and her newborn child during delivery at Deep Nursing Home. The complainant, Manmeet Singh Mattewal, alleged negligence in post-delivery care due to inadequate equipment and delayed blood arrangement, seeking substantial compensation. The SCDRC found Deep Nursing Home and Dr. Kanwarjit Kochhar negligent in post-delivery management and awarded compensation.</p>\n\n<p>On appeal, the NCDRC shifted the liability entirely to Dr. Kochhar, finding him negligent in antenatal management for not prescribing certain tests, despite acknowledging no negligence in delivery or post-delivery care. The Supreme Court found that the NCDRC overstepped its jurisdiction by creating a new case of antenatal negligence, which was not part of the original complaint. The Court cited previous rulings, emphasizing that decisions must be based on pleaded grounds and parties cannot be taken by surprise.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, dismissing the complaint and directing Manmeet Singh Mattewal to refund \u20b910,00,000/- received during the litigation, to be paid to New India Assurance Company and the doctors involved. The judgment underscores the importance of adhering to pleadings and expert medical opinions in consumer cases.</p>",

    "title": "Gauhati High Court Upholds Right to Free Books and Uniforms under the RTE Act",
    "description": "<p>The Gauhati High Court, in Master Rehan Barai & Anr. v. State of Assam & Ors., reaffirmed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act), directing that children admitted under Section 12(1)(c) are entitled to free textbooks and uniforms, in addition to free admission. This ruling stemmed from a case where children were denied regular classes due to their parents' inability to pay for these materials, despite being admitted under the RTE Act.</p>\n\n<p>The school authorities agreed to provide the books and uniforms, with the understanding that the State Government would reimburse the costs under Section 12(2) of the RTE Act. The Court referenced precedents, including the Supreme Court's ruling in Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan v. Union of India, which upheld the validity of Section 12(1)(c) and emphasized the State's duty to ensure universal elementary education.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Kaushik Goswami directed the school to provide the necessary materials and further ordered that remedial classes be arranged to help the children catch up with their peers, given the classes they had missed. This decision reinforces the substantive nature of the right to education, ensuring that children are equipped with the tools necessary for meaningful participation. The judgment underscores the importance of accountability for private schools operating under the RTE mandate and the State's role in timely reimbursement and strict compliance monitoring to ensure genuinely free and accessible education for all children.</p>",
