    "title": "From Shelf to Scooter: The Legal Mess Behind India\u2019s 10-Minute Commerce Boom",
    "description": "<p>India's burgeoning quick commerce sector, characterized by companies promising deliveries in 10 minutes or less, faces substantial legal and regulatory hurdles. These challenges range from zoning violations due to strategically located \"dark stores\" in residential areas to food safety concerns and questions surrounding the rights and classifications of gig workers as \"independent contractors\". The article also considers the impacts on cost per order, profitability, and service fees on consumer interests.</p>\n\n<p>Regulatory compliance remains a major concern. Quick commerce platforms, often classified as IT companies, navigate grey areas to sidestep stringent retail regulations and labor laws which enable them to engage in predatory pricing practices. This has prompted investigations from the Competition Commission of India (CCI).</p>\n\n<p>The sector also grapples with economic sustainability. High operational costs and initially low average order values (AOV) present profitability challenges. While some platforms have managed to increase their AOV, this often involves offering higher-value product categories, each bringing its own regulatory and compliance complexities. Service fees and packaging costs further impact consumer interest and raise concerns from consumer protection agencies.</p>\n\n<p>Consumer protection is another critical area of focus. The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) scrutinizes delivery time claims and addresses issues like differential pricing based on device type. The CCPA is also cracking down on \"dark patterns\" through self-audits required of e-commerce platforms, designed to promote ethical and transparent user interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the gig worker model employed by many quick commerce platforms has been under the scanner. Concerns arise regarding fair working conditions, lack of social security benefits, and pressures leading to unsafe practices. States like Rajasthan and Karnataka are introducing ordinances and acts to protect gig workers' rights and ensure welfare.</p>\n\n<p>Food safety is also a major area of regulatory focus. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has issued comprehensive guidelines and licensing requirements for e-commerce food businesses, addressing concerns over hygiene and standards. Compliance is critical, with penalties for violations.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, compliance with Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodity) Rules, 2011, is crucial to prevent misleading practices in quantity declaration and product labeling. Similarly, data privacy concerns arise from the vast amounts of consumer data collected by these platforms, with the Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, aiming to regulate data collection, usage, and storage.</p>\n\n<p>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in retail e-commerce in India is allowed up to 100% under the automatic route for marketplaces, while inventory-based e-commerce is not permitted, balancing the need for foreign capital with the protection of domestic businesses. Lastly, ensuring quality standards through hallmarking and adherence to BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) is essential for products like jewelry and electronics to protect consumers from substandard goods.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Mumbai Suburban, recently addressed a consumer complaint, *Gargi Prakash Joshi & Another v. Wow Momos Foods Pvt. Ltd.*, concerning alleged deficiency in service under Section 35(1)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The case centered on the serving of non-vegetarian food instead of vegetarian, raising issues of consumer rights and corporate responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>The complainants alleged that despite specifically requesting vegetarian momos at a Wow Momos outlet, they were served chicken momos, resulting in mental trauma and hurt religious sentiments. They sought Rs. 6,00,000 in compensation for deficiency in service and emotional distress. The opposing party refuted these claims, stating the invoice indicated a non-vegetarian order, and that clear labeling was available. They further argued that the complainants did not qualify as \"consumers\" under the Act due to a processed refund and rejected goodwill compensation offer.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Commission dismissed the complaint, citing a lack of sufficient evidence to prove the complainants ordered vegetarian momos or consumed non-vegetarian items unintentionally. The commission found the labelling on the display board provided clarity.</p>",

    "title": "Bombay High Court Grants Full Reimbursement for Heart Surgery, Prioritizing Right to Life",
    "description": "<p>In a significant ruling, the Bombay High Court in *Anirudh Prataprai Nansi v. Union of India* directed the Central Government to fully reimburse \u20b922,08,440 to Mr. Nansi, a retired government employee, for a heart transplant conducted at a private hospital. The court emphasized the primacy of Article 21 of the Constitution, safeguarding the right to life, in cases where essential medical treatment is unavailable through government-sponsored channels.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from Mr. Nansi's urgent need for a heart transplant due to severe cardiomyopathy. Because no Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS)-approved hospital in Mumbai was equipped to perform the procedure at the time, he underwent the transplant at a private facility. The CGHS authorities initially approved a reimbursement based on an outdated CGHS-Mumbai rate of \u20b969,000, which was significantly lower than the actual expenses.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court strongly criticized the CGHS's narrow, technical approach, asserting that rigid procedural compliance should give way to compassion and constitutional values in life-saving situations. The court highlighted that heart transplants are inherently urgent, the right to health is integral to Article 21, and the government has the power to relax guidelines in medical emergencies. It also emphasized that the lack of empanelled facilities cannot justify denying essential care and questioned the outdated and discriminatory reimbursement rates. The judgment reinforces that public health policies must prioritize the well-being and constitutional rights of individuals, especially in critical medical situations.</p>",

    "title": "IndiaMART vs. PUMA: Balancing IP Protection and Intermediary Liability in the Digital Age",
    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court's judgment in *IndiaMART Intermesh Limited vs. PUMA SE* addresses the complex intersection of intellectual property rights and intermediary liability in the context of a B2B digital marketplace. The case centered on PUMA's claim that IndiaMART facilitated trademark infringement by allowing unauthorized sellers to use \"PUMA\" as a keyword, leading to the sale of counterfeit goods on its platform. PUMA argued that IndiaMART was directly infringing its registered trademarks under Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999.</p>\n\n<p>IndiaMART, however, contended that it acted solely as an intermediary under Section 2(1)(w) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, providing a platform for sellers to list products without altering their content. The platform argued that it should not be held liable for third-party information listed on its website, citing Section 79(1) of the IT Act which provides a \"safe harbor\" for intermediaries. PUMA countered that IndiaMART's actions amounted to passing off and that they had received consumer complaints of counterfeit PUMA products being sold on IndiaMART's platform.</p>\n\n<p>The Delhi High Court overturned the Single Judge\u2019s order, stating that merely offering \"PUMA\" as a keyword did not constitute trademark infringement under Section 29 of the Trade Marks Act. The court found that IndiaMART provided listing services where buyers and sellers negotiated directly, functioning more like a directory facilitating product classification. Furthermore, the court upheld IndiaMART's immunity as an intermediary under Section 79(1) of the IT Act, emphasizing that intermediaries are not liable for third-party content unless they have \"actual knowledge\" of unlawful content based on court orders or governmental notifications.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the ruling clarifies that intermediary platforms like IndiaMART are not directly liable for trademark infringement based solely on user-generated listings or keyword metadata. The judgement strikes a balance between protecting intellectual property rights and enabling innovation in the digital economy by requiring platforms to have compliant content moderation systems, and emphasizes collaboration between intermediaries, brand owners, and regulatory bodies to combat counterfeit goods.</p>",

    "title": "Consumer Forum Rejects Insurer's Restrictive Interpretation of 'Accident' in Rabies Death Case",
    "description": "<p>The Uttarakhand State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission ruled in favor of the complainant, Smt. Meera Srivastava, against IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Co. Ltd., reinforcing that insurers must base claim denials on explicit policy provisions rather than vague interpretations. The case stemmed from the insurer's refusal to honor a personal accident insurance claim following the death of Smt. Srivastava's husband due to complications from rabies.</p>\n\n<p>The insurer repudiated the claim, arguing that the policy covered events like road accidents or burns, not infectious diseases. However, the Commission found that the policy lacked any specific exclusion for rabies or related infections, rejecting the insurer's restrictive interpretation of \"injury\" as defined by the policy.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission invoked the principle of *contra proferentem*, stating that any ambiguity in the policy wording must be interpreted in favor of the policyholder. They held that the insurer's repudiation was unjustified and constituted a deficiency in service. As a result, the Commission directed IFFCO Tokio to pay the insured amount, along with compensation for mental anguish and litigation costs. This decision underscores the importance of clear and consistent policy language, ensuring that insurers honor the reasonable expectations of policyholders and avoid unjustified claim denials.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Supreme Court of India are taking significant steps to ensure digital Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are accessible and inclusive, particularly for persons with disabilities (PwDs). This push aligns with the Digital India Programme, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Supreme Court's judgment in Pragya Prasun v. Union of India has broadened the scope of Article 21 of the Constitution to include digital accessibility as a fundamental right.</p>\n\n<p>The legal framework emphasizes equal rights for individuals with disabilities, mandating access to information and communication technologies. Sections of the RPwD Act guarantee financial autonomy and require service providers to achieve accessibility compliance. Enforcement involves nodal officer appointments, periodic audits with visually impaired individuals, and alternative liveness verification methods for KYC. Inclusive communication options, such as sign language and accessible formats, are crucial for equitable access.</p>\n\n<p>SEBI has directed registered intermediaries to adopt alternative verification methods, moving beyond traditional practices that may exclude PwDs. These alternatives include head movements, OTP-based authentication, and real-time video recordings, ensuring equal access to financial services. This initiative is monumental in redefining inclusivity, fostering autonomy, and emphasizing the responsibility of service providers to adopt universal design principles. By mandating accessibility audits and alternative KYC methods, the Supreme Court has reinforced the need for inclusive digital services, highlighting the State\u2019s responsibility to ensure equitable access for persons with disabilities.</p>",

    "title": "New CERSAI Compliance: Source of Funds Now Mandatory for SI Filings",
    "description": "<p>CERSAI has announced a new compliance requirement mandating financial institutions to disclose the source of funds when registering a security interest. This initiative seeks to enhance regulatory oversight and transparency, particularly in lending arrangements involving on-lending or refinance structures.</p>\n\n<p>Established under the SARFAESI Act, CERSAI maintains a central registry of charges over various assets, ensuring the legal enforceability of security interests and preventing fraudulent multiple financing. The new mandate introduces mandatory fields for lenders to specify the \"Type of Lending\" (direct, on-lending, or refinance), the \"Source of Fund Entity ID\" (of the original lending institution like NABARD), and the \"Source of Fund Security Interest ID\" (for refinance secured by a prior charge).</p>\n\n<p>These changes will impact banks, NBFCs, and other lending institutions, requiring them to adapt their registration processes. Institutions are advised to proactively update their systems and procedures to incorporate the new mandatory fields, ensuring compliance and uninterrupted legal enforceability of their secured interests. This regulatory development aims to bring greater clarity and control over lending chains and fund flows, particularly in multi-layered credit structures, thus enhancing the governance of secured lending.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In the case of MA v Superintendent of Police, the Madras High Court has reinforced the recognition of same-sex couples as a family unit, despite the absence of legal same-sex marriage in India. The ruling stemmed from a habeas corpus petition, filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, alleging unlawful detention and coercion against an individual by their natal family due to their sexual orientation.</p>\n\n<p>The court's decision, delivered by Justice G.R. Swaminathan and Justice V. Lakshminarayan, favored the petitioner and emphasized the detainee's right to personal autonomy and choice in relationships. The judgment acknowledged that the definition of family extends beyond traditional norms to include chosen families, particularly those within the LGBTQIA+ community. This aligns with evolving jurisprudence, including landmark cases like NALSA v. Union of India and Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India, which have contributed to the decriminalization and recognition of LGBTQIA+ rights.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court criticized societal prejudices and police insensitivity, highlighting the state's duty to protect LGBTQIA+ individuals' rights. The court ultimately allowed the detainee to leave with the petitioner, restraining the natal family from interfering and mandating police protection for the couple. This ruling marks a crucial step in safeguarding the rights and liberties of LGBTQIA+ individuals in India, particularly in the ongoing absence of comprehensive legislative recognition for same-sex relationships.</p>",

Ajay Kumar & Ors*, addressed the principles governing the quashing of FIRs, particularly in cases involving allegations of fraud and misappropriation. The case arose from a loan agreement where the appellant, Abhishek Singh, pledged gold ornaments as collateral, later discovering the gold was deemed counterfeit by the bank after he repaid the loan.</p>\n\n<p>The Patna High Court had quashed Singh's FIR, considering it a retaliatory measure lacking prima facie evidence and citing procedural non-compliance. However, the Supreme Court overturned this decision, emphasizing that an FIR should only be quashed if it doesn't disclose a prima facie case. The Supreme Court found that the High Court had improperly engaged in evidentiary appreciation, a function reserved for trial.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court reiterated that the allegations in Singh's FIR did present a prima facie case, warranting further investigation through a trial. The Court clarified that its decision does not reflect any opinion on the merits of the case or the guilt of either party. Ultimately, the Supreme Court restored the FIR and directed the trial court to proceed with the matter in accordance with the law, reinforcing the need for caution when considering the quashing of an FIR.</p>",

The court examined the legal responsibilities of developers and consumer rights under Indian law.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose when Anupam Garg, after being allotted a flat in 2012 with a possession date of May 21, 2015, found no progress on-site and opted out, filing a consumer complaint after GMADA's delayed possession offer in June 2016 included unilateral project changes.</p>\n\n<p>The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC) and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) ruled in favor of Garg, directing GMADA to refund the deposit with 8% interest, compensate for mental distress and litigation costs, and cover the loan interest paid by Garg.</p>\n\n<p>GMADA appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing against liability for loan interest. The Supreme Court, referencing precedents, concluded that the already awarded 8% interest adequately compensated for the delay, clarifying that while Commissions can grant compensation, it must be tied to specific losses suffered. The Court ruled GMADA was not liable for the respondent's loan interest.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court's decision clarified that while reasonable compensation is necessary for delays or service deficiencies, it must be based on the actual losses incurred, preventing undue financial burdens on developers while ensuring accountability and fairness in the housing market.</p>",

The case stemmed from Harinagar Sugar Mills Limited's (HSML) closure of its biscuit division following the termination of a long-standing job work agreement with Britannia Industries Limited (BIL).</p>\n\n<p>HSML applied for closure, but the Government of Maharashtra requested additional information, which HSML provided.

Loan-to-Value (LTV) caps have been introduced and must be maintained throughout the loan tenure, alongside standardized assaying and valuation procedures. Consumer protection measures, operational restrictions, AML checks, guidelines for top-up loans and renewals, collateral management, auction transparency, and provisions for unclaimed collateral are also outlined. Furthermore, lenders are required to disclose detailed loan portfolio information relating to gold and silver-backed loans in their financial statements.</p>\n\n<p>The RBI's 2025 Directions represent a forward-looking regulatory stance, unifying legacy norms into a single set of principles to promote responsible and transparent gold loan practices.

Any duly authorized bank official with access to the necessary records is competent to testify, thereby overturning a Trial Magistrate's overly strict procedural interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a Section 138 complaint where a cheque was dishonored due to insufficient funds. When the complainant presented an authorized bank representative in lieu of the Branch Manager, the Trial Magistrate refused to record their testimony, demanding a formal substitution application. The High Court found this insistence on procedural formalities to be excessive and legally incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Sanjay Dhar clarified that any responsible bank officer with access to account records in the ordinary course of business can testify to documentary evidence, such as cheque return memos, without needing personal knowledge. The Court also deemed the invocation of Section 302 of the Criminal Procedure Code unnecessary, as it obstructs the summary nature of Section 138 proceedings. The admissibility of such evidence is governed by Sections 65B and 67 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which facilitate the admission of electronic and documentary records maintained in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n\n<p>This decision aligns with existing legal principles promoting swift justice in cheque dishonor cases, as emphasized by the Supreme Court in *Indian Bank Association v.

    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court, in *Subhash v. Mamta @ Raksha*, reaffirmed that a husband's obligation to maintain his wife and child under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA), which provides for interim maintenance during matrimonial proceedings, cannot be diminished by citing personal financial commitments like loan EMIs or insurance premiums. The court emphasized that maintenance calculations should be based on the husband's earning capacity and gross income, excluding voluntary expenses, thus safeguarding dependent spouses and children from attempts to evade maintenance responsibilities.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a marital dispute where the wife sought interim maintenance after the husband filed for divorce. The Family Court ordered the husband, with a declared monthly income of \u20b947,000, to pay \u20b915,000 monthly for the wife and child. The husband challenged this, arguing reduced disposable income due to loan obligations and insurance payments. The High Court rejected these arguments, stating that voluntary financial obligations cannot supersede the primary duty to maintain dependents.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's analysis aligned with the Supreme Court\u2019s stance in *Manish Jain v. Akanksha Jain*, emphasizing that financial commitments like home loans cannot dilute the legal duty of maintenance. The court also found the wife's unemployment to be genuine due to caregiving responsibilities, consistent with *Shailja & Anr. v. Khobbanna*, which affirms a qualified wife's entitlement to maintenance if she's not earning due to legitimate duties. The ruling reinforces the judiciary's commitment to protecting the financial well-being of spouses and children post-separation. Voluntary personal expenses cannot reduce statutory maintenance.

    "description": "<p>Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC), or spam, poses significant challenges in the digital age, including privacy violations and cybersecurity risks. These unrequested messages, promoting goods or services, necessitate robust regulations and technological solutions to protect consumers. The Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, and its subsequent amendments, aim to tackle UCC through enhanced measures.</p>\n\n<p>The TCCCPR defines UCC as any commercial communication that doesn't align with the recipient's consent, excluding transactional and government-issued messages. The Second Amendment, introduced in 2025, refines the framework by classifying mixed promotional content as promotional, requiring prior notification for auto-diallers, and implementing stricter provider obligations such as communication authentication and adherence to regulations. A key update is the abolishment of inferred consent from existing business relationships, mandating fresh consent after service contract termination.</p>\n\n<p>A streamlined complaint mechanism, featuring a standardised format and quicker response times, is now in place to bolster consumer control. Consumers can report UCC with minimal information, and service providers must respond within five days. Violators face penalties ranging from fines to blacklisting and service disconnection. Technical measures, consumer education campaigns, and proactive registration with \"do-not-disturb\" services further aid in combating spam.</p>\n\n<p>Globally, countries are employing various strategies, with India's blockchain-based Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) framework setting a high standard by ensuring transparency, accountability, and explicit consent. This contrasts with the US CAN-SPAM Act's opt-out mechanisms and the EU GDPR's focus on explicit consent. Effective UCC mitigation requires collaborative efforts among regulators, telecom providers, and consumers, along with ongoing innovation and the adoption of best practices to foster trust and integrity in digital communication.</p>",

S. v State of Kerala and Ors*, reaffirmed an individual's constitutional right under Article 25 to freely choose and reflect their religious identity in official records. The ruling, delivered by Justice D.K. Singh, centered on a petitioner's request to amend his name and religion in his educational documents.</p>\n\n<p>Sudhin Krishna C.S., originally registered as Mohammed Riyazudeen C.S., sought to correct his records to reflect his Hindu identity, which he adopted upon reaching adulthood. The District Educational Officer (DEO) denied his request, citing the Kerala Education Rules (KER), 1959, as not explicitly allowing such changes. The petitioner then appealed to the Kerala High Court, arguing that Rule 3(1) of Chapter VI of the KER permitted such amendments.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioner contended that Rule 3(1) of Chapter VI of the KER explicitly allows changes to details such as name, religion, and caste, citing the violation of religious freedom under Article 25 of the Constitution. The respondents countered that the KER primarily addressed corrections to dates of birth, limiting the Commissioner of Examinations' authority to make broader changes.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court interpreted Rule 3(1) of Chapter VI of the KER to encompass alterations beyond just the date of birth, extending to personal details like name, religion, and caste. The court directed the respondents to amend the petitioner's educational records to accurately reflect his chosen name and religion, underscoring the principles of personal liberty, self-determination, and the right to an accurate representation of one\u2019s chosen identity in official documents.</p>",

Key changes include raising the legal age for purchasing tobacco products from 18 to 21 years and increasing the maximum fine for violations from \u20b9200 to \u20b91,000. The legislation aims to strengthen tobacco control and reduce consumption, particularly among youth.</p>\n\n<p>The amendment broadens the prohibition of tobacco use in public places to include both smoking and spitting, while allowing designated smoking areas in larger hotels, restaurants, and airports that meet specific requirements. A complete ban on hookah bars has also been introduced, reflecting the state's effort to regulate tobacco consumption in social environments. The sale of tobacco products is now restricted to individuals 21 years and older, and increased scrutiny will be applied to sales near educational institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Significant penalties have been introduced for operating hookah bars, including imprisonment from one to three years and fines ranging from \u20b950,000 to \u20b91,00,000. Dr. U.S. Vishal Rao, a member of Karnataka\u2019s High-Powered Committee on Tobacco Control, believes these amendments are a crucial step in curbing tobacco use among the younger population.

The petitions, filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, challenged the imposition of interest, penalties, and interest on penalties related to AGR.</p>\n\n<p>The core issue stems from differing interpretations of AGR between telecom operators and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). A 2019 Supreme Court judgment sided with the DoT, significantly increasing the financial liabilities of telecom companies. While the Court allowed payment in ten annual installments in 2020, the operators sought further relief in 2025, arguing that interest and penalties were economically unsustainable.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court bench dismissed the petitions, emphasizing that Article 32 cannot be used to reopen conclusively decided matters. The Court underscored the importance of judicial discipline and the finality of its judgments, signaling that the remedy for economic grievances lies in policy engagement, not repeated litigation. This decision reinforces legal certainty for the telecom sector, urging companies to focus on operational stability and financial restructuring within the established framework of AGR liabilities and payment timelines.</p>",

The Controller had cited Section 3(b) of the Patents Act, 1970, expressing concerns about public health and morality related to the device's potential use, particularly given the Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Act, 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The Court emphasized that patent denials based solely on moral or public health grounds require independent scientific or technical evidence, and subjective notions are insufficient justification. The Controller's assumption that the invention was exclusively intended for tobacco products was incorrect, as the device could be used with various substrates.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Ravi Krishnan Kapur clarified that the e-cigarette ban addresses commercial activities, not the inherent patentability of an invention. Furthermore, the Controller's reliance on undisclosed documents violated principles of natural justice, denying ITC an opportunity to respond and rendering the decision procedurally flawed. The court has reaffirmed that bans on sale or distribution of products do not automatically equate to a ban on innovation and that health regulations should not unduly influence patent decisions.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, the High Court set aside the Controller's order and remanded the matter for a fresh decision, stressing the need for a hearing and adherence to scientific and technical grounds. This ruling underscores the importance of relying on evidence-based assessments in patent law and establishes a narrower interpretation of Section 3(b), reinforcing the separation between health regulations and patent eligibility.</p>",

    "title": "Breaking the Mold: Can Courts Now Rewrite Arbitral Awards?",
    "description": "<p>In *Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft Technologies Ltd.*, a Supreme Court Constitution Bench addressed the power of Indian courts to modify arbitral awards under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The 4:1 majority held that limited judicial modification is permissible in specific circumstances, including clerical errors, severable portions, post-award interest, and under Article 142. This departs from the earlier decision in *NHAI v. Hakeem*, raising concerns about judicial overreach and its impact on the finality and autonomy of arbitration.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from conflicting judicial opinions regarding the power of Indian courts to modify arbitral awards, with some allowing it and others ruling against it. The Supreme Court aimed to resolve whether courts can modify awards or only set them aside. The Arbitration Act, modeled on the UNCITRAL Model Law, emphasizes limited court intervention, primarily allowing courts to set aside awards on specific grounds. However, the *Balasamy* ruling permits modifications in limited cases, sparking debate.</p>\n\n<p>Supporters argue that limited judicial modifications promote judicial economy and prevent delays. Opponents maintain that such powers conflict with the legislative intent of the Arbitration Act, potentially undermining arbitration's core principles and inviting further litigation. The ruling endorses judicial modifications under narrow circumstances and constitutional powers under Article 142. This interpretation has raised concerns about the integrity and indivisibility of arbitral awards, as well as potentially breaching the separation of powers.</p>\n\n<p>The majority's expansive view of Section 34 risks tactical litigation, weakens tribunal authority, and erodes arbitration\u2019s finality. Arbitral awards are generally unified instruments, and selectively modifying them compromises their coherence. Justice K.V. Viswanathan's dissent underscores that Article 142 cannot override clear statutory provisions, stressing judicial restraint and respect for legislative boundaries. Ultimately, the *Balasamy* decision introduces a nuanced approach, allowing limited court modifications, including severing invalid portions, correcting errors, modifying post-award interest, and invoking Article 142 to ensure complete justice.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in the case of *Kashmiri Lal Sharma v. Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board*, addressed the issue of retirement age disparities among employees with disabilities. The appellant, a 60% locomotor-disabled electrician, challenged his retirement at age 58, arguing it violated Article 14 of the Constitution due to an earlier Office Memorandum (OM) that allowed visually impaired employees to work until 60. The State later withdrew this OM, reverting the retirement age to 58 for all categories.</p>\n\n<p>The Court reaffirmed that setting the retirement age is a policy decision within the executive's purview, subject to the principles of equality. The appellant contended that the disparity violated Article 14 and that he had a legitimate expectation to work until 60 due to the OM's earlier existence. Conversely, the State argued that the OM's withdrawal negated any claims for extended retirement.</p>\n\n<p>Referencing the Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 1995, and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016, the Court emphasized the need for equal treatment regarding employment benefits for individuals with benchmark disabilities. While partially allowing the appeal, the Court ruled that the appellant was entitled to full wages and benefits until the OM's withdrawal date (November 4, 2019) and that his pension should be calculated accordingly. The Court firmly stated that employees do not have a vested right to continue employment beyond the date of the OM's withdrawal, reinforcing the executive's right to determine retirement age through policy decisions, while still adhering to constitutional principles of fairness and equality.</p>",

The Adjudicating Authority terminated the CIRP, citing collusion, document fabrication, and misuse of the insolvency process.</p>\n\n<p>The NCLAT affirmed the NCLT\u2019s findings, emphasizing that the existence of debt and default does not shield a Section 7 application from scrutiny under Section 65 when collusion or abuse is proven.

The Court clarified that terminating the CIRP was an adjudication on fraud and not a review of the admission order.</p>\n\n<p>This decision reinforces the judiciary's commitment to preventing the strategic abuse of the IBC, 2016.

It provides a legal basis for social security, occupational health and safety, transparency in automated monitoring systems, and effective dispute resolution mechanisms. A \"gig worker\" is defined as an individual performing work based on a contract with a specified rate of payment, typically through a digital platform. Platforms are digital arrangements that assign tasks, while aggregators are digital intermediaries. A welfare fee, ranging from 1% to 5% of a worker's payout, will be levied on platforms to fund these entitlements.</p>\n\n<p>To administer the ordinance, a dedicated Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers Welfare Board will be established, comprising government officials, worker and aggregator representatives, civil society members, and technical experts. This statutory body, headquartered in Bengaluru, will have the power to acquire assets, enter into contracts, and initiate legal action. Platforms are required to register with the Board, provide fair contracts, and ensure transparency in algorithmic management.</p>\n\n<p>A Karnataka Gig Workers Social Security and Welfare Fund will be created, financed by welfare fees, voluntary contributions, government grants, and other permitted sources.

Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) will also need to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and audits.</p>\n\n<p>Additional strategic recommendations include establishing a robust incident response plan with assigned roles and periodic simulations, developing customizable breach notification templates, fostering cross-departmental collaboration and staff training, and strengthening data security infrastructure through state-of-the-art verification technologies. By taking these steps, organizations can proactively address compliance requirements, mitigate data privacy risks, and foster trust in the digital economy.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has introduced \"Guidelines for the Prevention and Regulation of Illegal Listing and Sale of Radio Equipment including Walkie-Talkies on E-Commerce Platforms, 2025,\" under Section 18 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. These guidelines aim to regulate the sale of radio equipment, including walkie-talkies, on e-commerce platforms to ensure compliance with national telecommunications and security standards. They apply to all e-commerce platforms catering to Indian consumers, as well as manufacturers, importers, and sellers of radio equipment, defining key terms like \"Radio Equipment\" and \"Unauthorized Devices.\"</p>\n\n<p>The guidelines mandate that no radio equipment requiring frequency assignment from the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) can be listed or sold unless purchased from an authorized dealer. Platforms are prohibited from listing mobile signal boosters and wireless jammers. Product listings must specify frequency ranges, technical parameters, and regulatory approval proof like Equipment Type Approval (ETA). Platforms must implement automated scanning systems to detect non-compliant listings and provide a user-friendly reporting mechanism for the public.</p>\n\n<p>E-commerce platforms must ensure sellers certify the authenticity of test reports and remove non-compliant listings within 24 hours of receiving directions from the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) or DOT. They are also required to cooperate with regulators for real-time takedowns, enforcement actions, and submit regular audits and compliance reports. Non-compliance can lead to penalties under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, and other applicable laws, including blacklisting of sellers and platform liability.</p>\n\n<p>The guidelines also emphasize collaboration with regulatory authorities for enforcement actions and public awareness. Platforms must display notices about the risks of purchasing unauthorized devices and educate users on frequency compliance to promote informed consumer behavior. These measures aim to protect consumers, maintain security standards, and ensure adherence to legal and technical standards.</p>",

The FSSAI has observed an increase in the use of this term, which, although seemingly straightforward, is ambiguous and can convey a false sense of absolute purity or superiority, potentially misleading consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Issued under the authority of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and referencing the Food Safety and Standards (Advertising and Claims) Regulations, 2018, the advisory highlights that claims must be truthful, unambiguous, and not misleading. Sub-regulation 10(7) of these regulations strictly prohibits any advertisement or claim that undermines other manufacturers or influences consumer perception in a misleading manner.</p>\n\n<p>The advisory directs all Food Business Operators (FBOs) to discontinue the use of the term \u201c100%\u201d on food product labels, packaging, and promotional content, whether used alone or with other descriptors. The FSSAI emphasizes that the term is undefined in the FSS Act, 2006, or its related regulations, and its use can lead to consumer confusion and misinterpretation. This measure is intended to prevent misleading claims, ensure transparency and accuracy in marketing practices, and maintain high standards of food safety and consumer protection within the food industry.</p>",

This decision underscores the judiciary's dedication to the timely resolution of disputes through arbitration, as mandated by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a 2010 Work Order between Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited (Petitioner) and Sopan Projects (Respondent) for the construction of an underground MDPE pipeline. Disputes arose when the Respondent allegedly abandoned the project before completion, leading to the invocation of arbitration in October 2015. A sole arbitrator was nominated, and final arguments concluded in March 2020. However, with no award issued after three years, the Petitioner sought termination of the arbitrator's mandate under Section 14 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>\n\n<p>The Petitioner argued that the delay contravened public policy, while the Respondent contended that unpaid fees and periods covered by a Supreme Court order justified the delay. The Respondent also claimed the Petitioner did not attempt to follow up with the arbitrator.</p>\n\n<p>The Delhi High Court, referencing Section 14 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and previous Supreme Court rulings, emphasized the importance of expeditious arbitration proceedings. The court concluded that the arbitrator's unexplained three-year delay warranted termination of their mandate, reinforcing the necessity for efficient dispute resolution in accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p>",

Prompted by concerns raised by researchers and discussions within the Drugs Consultative Committee (DCC), the document aims to mitigate ecological and public health risks associated with improper pharmaceutical waste management.</p>\n\n<p>The guidance document addresses the severe consequences of improper disposal, including water contamination, potential misuse of expired drugs, and the emergence of adverse drug reactions. Its primary objective is to provide clear instructions for the safe disposal of expired and unused drugs, aligning with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules while minimizing environmental impact, especially in relation to antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</p>\n\n<p>The document outlines several disposal methods, including landfill in engineered sites, waste immobilization via encapsulation and inertization, and sewer disposal for certain liquid pharmaceuticals. It discourages open burning and recommends medium to high-temperature incineration for specific waste types, with chemical decomposition as an alternative when incineration is not feasible. Existing regulations for imported drugs, retail/wholesale outlets, and manufacturing waste are referenced, aligning with the Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016.</p>\n\n<p>The guidance document details the procedures for various stakeholders, including retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, hospitals, and government agencies, emphasizing the return of expired/unused drugs to manufacturers or proper disposal according to the outlined guidelines. It also specifies requirements for maintaining detailed records for regulatory verification and the handling and transportation of expired/unused drugs, including cytotoxic, radioactive, and controlled substances, using yellow non-chlorinated plastic bags or containers.</p>\n\n<p>For the general public, the document suggests establishing \"Drug take back\" sites and provides guidance on medicines that can be flushed down the sink or toilet to prevent accidental ingestion and misuse, aiming to minimize risks to people and pets.

Krishna Iyer</b>, affirmed the principle that <b>bail is the rule and jail is the exception</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The accused, <b>Balchand alias Baliay</b>, was convicted of housebreaking and theft under <b>Sections 457</b> and <b>380</b> of the <b>Indian Penal Code</b>. During his appeal against the conviction, he was granted interim bail, which the <b>State of Rajasthan</b> challenged on the grounds that a conviction extinguishes the presumption of innocence.</p>\n\n<p>The Court considered whether a conviction automatically deprives an accused of the right to bail pending appeal, and how to balance <b>societal security</b> with an individual\u2019s <b>fundamental liberty</b>. The prosecution contended that conviction nullifies the presumption of innocence and mandates bail cancellation, while the defense argued that the appeal process is an extension of the trial and preserves the accused\u2019s right to liberty until final judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Krishna Iyer\u2019s judgment emphasized that the <b>presumption of innocence</b> endures until all appellate remedies are exhausted. He underscored that under <b>Article 21</b> of the Constitution, personal liberty must be deprived only through a process that is just, fair, and reasonable. The Court held that \u201c<b>bail is the rule</b>\u201d and that bail may be denied only in exceptional circumstances such as flight risk, tampering with evidence, or threat to public order. It ruled that bail cannot be revoked automatically upon conviction, but must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, ensuring the justice system protects both liberty and public interest.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling established the foundation of modern <b>bail jurisprudence</b> in India, affirming that even a convicted person retains dignity and the right to judicial review. It has guided subsequent judgments to resist mechanical denials of bail and reinforced that restrictions on liberty must be grounded in substantial reasons.</p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, the decision balances <b>personal freedom</b> and <b>public safety</b>, favoring release unless compelling reasons demand custody.

When Sylvia\u2019s extramarital affair with Prem Ahuja, a wealthy businessman, came to light, Nanavati confronted them. In an emotionally charged encounter, he took his service revolver and went to Prem Ahuja\u2019s residence, where he fatally shot him.</p>\n\n<p>Key legal questions arose: whether Nanavati\u2019s act amounted to murder under <b>Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)</b>, and whether it could be reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <b>Exception 1 to Section 300 IPC</b> for grave and sudden provocation.</p>\n\n<p>At the Bombay Sessions Court, a jury trial returned a \u201cNot Guilty\u201d verdict by 8:1.

    "title": "Cheque Bounce Recovery in India: Your Legal Options Explained",
    "description": "<p>In India, a <b>cheque bounce</b>, technically known as <b>dishonor of cheque</b>, is a criminal offense punishable under Section 138 of the <b>Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881</b>. This happens when a bank refuses to honor a cheque due to insufficient funds in the drawer's account, or for other reasons like signature mismatch. For an ordinary citizen, receiving a bounced cheque can be a frustrating experience, but it's crucial to understand the legal options available to recover the owed amount.</p>\n\n<p>The process for <b>cheque bounce recovery</b> begins with sending a legal notice to the issuer of the cheque. This notice must be sent within 30 days from the date the bank informs you about the dishonor of the cheque. The notice should demand payment of the cheque amount within 15 days. If the issuer fails to make the payment within this period, you have the right to file a criminal complaint in the court of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, within one month from the date of expiry of the 15-day notice period. This initiates legal proceedings under Section 138 of the <b>Negotiable Instruments Act</b>.</p>\n\n<p>A critical aspect of the <b>Section 138</b> case is establishing that the debt or liability exists. The onus is on the complainant to prove that the cheque was issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or other liability. The drawer of the cheque has the opportunity to defend themselves, and the court will consider both sides before delivering a judgment. If the court finds the accused guilty, they can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the criminal proceedings under Section 138, it's also possible to initiate a civil suit for recovery of money. While the criminal case aims to penalize the defaulter, a civil suit aims to recover the outstanding amount along with interest and other costs. Filing a civil suit doesn't preclude initiating criminal proceedings, and both can proceed simultaneously. The legal recourse available to an individual who receives a <b>bounced cheque</b> provides substantial protection, ensuring that financial transactions are honored and that remedies are available when defaults occur.</p>",

    "title": "Indian Landlord Rights: Eviction Rules You Need to Know",
    "description": "<p>In India, landlords have specific rights when it comes to evicting a tenant, governed primarily by the respective state's <b>Rent Control Act</b>. These Acts vary across states, but generally, a landlord cannot evict a tenant at will. A valid and legal ground for eviction must exist, such as non-payment of rent, causing nuisance, subletting without permission, or using the property for illegal activities. It's crucial for landlords to understand the specific provisions of the Rent Control Act applicable in their state to ensure any eviction process complies with the law.</p>\n\n<p>The process of eviction typically involves serving a legal notice to the tenant, clearly stating the reason for eviction and giving them a reasonable timeframe to vacate the premises. If the tenant fails to comply, the landlord can then file an eviction suit in the appropriate court. The court will then hear both sides of the argument, examining the evidence presented by both the landlord and the tenant. The burden of proof usually lies with the landlord to demonstrate that a valid ground for eviction exists under the relevant <b>Rent Control Act</b>. Landlords must keep accurate records of rent payments, communication with the tenant, and any violations of the rental agreement to support their case.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that even with a valid reason for eviction, a landlord cannot use force or illegal means to evict a tenant. Such actions can result in legal repercussions for the landlord, including penalties and damages. The eviction process must be carried out through the court, obtaining a court order for eviction if necessary. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of following due process of law in eviction matters. For example, the landmark case of *Raghunath G. Panhale (Dead) By Lrs. v. M/S. Chaganlal Sundarji And Co* highlighted the need for strict adherence to procedural laws in eviction proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>For ordinary citizens who are landlords, understanding these <b>eviction rules</b> is crucial for protecting their property rights while also acting within the bounds of the law. Seeking legal advice from a lawyer specializing in property law is highly recommended before initiating any eviction proceedings. This ensures compliance with the state's specific Rent Control Act and minimizes the risk of legal complications. Moreover, familiarizing oneself with relevant case laws can provide a better understanding of how courts interpret and apply these laws in practice. Remember that a fair and legal eviction process protects both the landlord's rights and the tenant's rights, promoting a more equitable rental relationship.</p>",

    "title": "Online Fraud Refund: Your Rights Under Indian Law",
    "description": "<p>If you've fallen victim to <b>online fraud</b> in India, knowing your rights concerning a <b>refund</b> is crucial. Indian law provides avenues for recovering lost funds, though the process can sometimes be complex. The primary legislation governing such issues is the <b>Information Technology Act, 2000</b>, which addresses cybercrimes and provides a framework for holding fraudsters accountable. Banks and payment service providers also have a responsibility to ensure secure transactions, and their negligence can lead to liability.</p>\n\n<p>The liability of banks in cases of <b>unauthorized electronic transactions</b> is often governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. These guidelines typically differentiate liability based on customer reporting timelines. If the customer reports the fraudulent transaction promptly (usually within 3 days), the liability is often limited or even zero. Delay in reporting can increase the customer's potential liability. Banks are required to have a robust dispute resolution mechanism to handle customer complaints regarding fraudulent transactions and provide a refund, if warranted. It is important to document all communications with the bank and file a formal complaint with evidence of the <b>fraudulent transaction</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond banking regulations, Section 43 of the <b>IT Act</b> deals with compensation for damages caused to computer systems and networks due to unauthorized access or disruption. While it may not directly guarantee a <b>refund</b>, it allows for claiming damages. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the <b>online fraud</b>, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) provisions related to cheating, forgery, and criminal breach of trust can also be invoked. Registering a First Information Report (FIR) with the police is a crucial step in initiating a criminal investigation and strengthens your case for seeking legal remedies.</p>\n\n<p>For ordinary citizens, the practical implication is to be vigilant and proactive. Immediately report any <b>online fraud</b> to your bank and the cybercrime cell. Keep records of all transactions and communication. File a police complaint to initiate formal investigation. Familiarizing yourself with RBI guidelines on limiting liability in fraudulent transactions can greatly help navigate the process of claiming a <b>refund</b>. Remember, acting quickly and diligently is essential to maximizing your chances of recovering your funds.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In India, a <b>live-in relationship</b> refers to an arrangement where two individuals choose to cohabit and share their lives together without being legally married. This form of relationship has gained increasing social acceptance, and the Indian legal system has gradually recognized certain rights and protections for couples in such arrangements. However, it's crucial to understand that live-in relationships don't automatically grant the same rights as a marriage. Proof of a relationship resembling marriage, including factors like duration, shared household, pooling of resources, and intent to marry, is often essential for claiming legal entitlements.</p>\n\n<p>Several landmark court judgments have shaped the legal landscape surrounding live-in relationships. The Supreme Court, in cases like D. Patchaiammal v. D. Velusamy, has laid down guidelines for determining the validity and nature of a live-in relationship. To be considered a valid relationship warranting legal protection, the couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses. Importantly, not all cohabitation qualifies as a live-in relationship entitled to legal rights. The court has emphasized the necessity of a long-standing and genuine relationship similar to marriage. These judicial pronouncements primarily aim to prevent exploitation and protect vulnerable partners within such arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>The legal implications for women in <b>live-in relationships</b> are particularly significant. While not explicitly covered under the Hindu Marriage Act, certain legislations like the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provide some recourse. This Act recognizes women in live-in relationships as being in a relationship \"in the nature of marriage,\" thereby entitling them to protection from domestic violence, including physical, emotional, and economic abuse. They can seek remedies such as residence orders, monetary relief, and protection orders under this Act. Further, children born out of live-in relationships are considered legitimate and have inheritance rights in their parents\u2019 property, as established by various court decisions.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that establishing legal rights within a <b>live-in relationship</b> can often be challenging. Unlike a formal marriage certificate, there's no single document that automatically proves the existence of the relationship or its nature. Individuals need to gather evidence, such as joint bank accounts, utility bills with both names, photographs, and testimonies of friends and family, to demonstrate the validity and characteristics of their relationship to the court. Seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer is highly recommended for individuals in live-in relationships to understand their rights and obligations and to navigate the legal complexities effectively. This is especially crucial in cases involving property disputes, maintenance claims, or inheritance matters.</p>",
