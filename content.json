    "title": "CDSCO Clarifies Permission for Imported Drugs: Overprinting, Stickering, and Stamping Under Rule 104A",
    "description": "<p>The Directorate General of Health Services and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) issued an Office Memorandum on May 26, 2025, clarifying the comprehensive permission for importing drugs for labelling, overprinting, and stickering under Rule 104A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. This memorandum expands upon a previous directive from January 29, 2020, to address specific requirements and conditions for these activities.</p>\n\n<p>Rule 104A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, generally prohibits altering manufacturer inscriptions on drug containers. However, alterations are permissible with Licensing Authority approval. The new Office Memorandum, issued by the Drugs Controller General (India), provides clarity on these permissible alterations, particularly for imported drugs.</p>\n\n<p>The memorandum specifies that labelling, overprinting, or stickering is only allowed for imported drugs. Importers must possess a valid manufacturing license to conduct these activities, ensuring regulatory oversight. Licensees must maintain adequate storage and labelling facilities and appoint qualified manufacturing and QA personnel, subject to State Licensing Authority (SLA) approval. While a QC laboratory and personnel may not be necessary, qualified personnel are critical to adhere to standards.</p>\n\n<p>The labelling process must comply with existing Drugs and Cosmetics Rules. The original label must remain visible, and the license number, along with a description of the activity performed, must be clearly indicated. For instance, drugs intended for CGHS supply should be labeled \u201cCGHS Supply Overprint.\u201d This clarification aims to ensure regulatory compliance and facilitate the import of drugs with specific labelling requirements.</p>",

    "title": "Navigating the Roadmap for DPDP Compliance: What Companies Need to Start On",
    "description": "<p>The impending Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules 2025 in India necessitate a proactive shift in organizational data governance. Compliance extends beyond mere regulatory adherence, presenting an opportunity to cultivate customer trust through robust data protection practices. Key principles of the DPDP Act, including accountability, transparency, data minimization, and proactive risk management, demand a comprehensive re-evaluation of existing data strategies.</p>\n\n<p>Initial steps for companies include performing a thorough gap assessment to align current processes with the DPDP Act requirements, focusing on obligations as data fiduciaries or processors. Prioritizing tasks with immediate external implications, such as consent management and clear communication with data principals, is crucial. System changes to enhance data security, including advanced data governance measures, encryption, access controls, and regular audits, are essential for compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Internal tasks encompass detailed data mapping and inventory, establishing data lifecycle management practices, and appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO), particularly for Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs). Strategic recommendations involve establishing a robust incident response plan with clear roles and periodic simulations, developing customizable breach notification templates, and implementing cross-departmental collaboration through a breach response team. Investing in advanced verification technologies, conducting public awareness campaigns, and facilitating collaboration between government agencies and private entities will further strengthen data security infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>The finalization of the DPDP Rules 2025 represents a significant stride in India's data protection framework. A structured, proactive, and adaptable approach is paramount for organizations to not only ensure compliance and mitigate risks but also to foster trust and maintain a competitive edge in the evolving data-driven economy.</p>",

    "title": "Bail is the Rule, Jail is the Exception \u2014 State of Rajasthan v. Balchand alias Baliay (1977)",
    "description": "<p>In <b>State of Rajasthan v. Balchand alias Baliay (1977)</b>, the Supreme Court of India, led by Justice <b>V.R. Krishna Iyer</b>, affirmed the principle that <b>bail is the rule and jail is the exception</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The accused, <b>Balchand alias Baliay</b>, was convicted of housebreaking and theft under <b>Sections 457</b> and <b>380</b> of the <b>Indian Penal Code</b>. During his appeal against the conviction, he was granted interim bail, which the <b>State of Rajasthan</b> challenged on the grounds that a conviction extinguishes the presumption of innocence.</p>\n\n<p>The Court considered whether a conviction automatically deprives an accused of the right to bail pending appeal, and how to balance <b>societal security</b> with an individual\u2019s <b>fundamental liberty</b>. The prosecution contended that conviction nullifies the presumption of innocence and mandates bail cancellation, while the defense argued that the appeal process is an extension of the trial and preserves the accused\u2019s right to liberty until final judgment.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Krishna Iyer\u2019s judgment emphasized that the <b>presumption of innocence</b> endures until all appellate remedies are exhausted. He underscored that under <b>Article 21</b> of the Constitution, personal liberty must be deprived only through a process that is just, fair, and reasonable. The Court held that \u201c<b>bail is the rule</b>\u201d and that bail may be denied only in exceptional circumstances such as flight risk, tampering with evidence, or threat to public order. It ruled that bail cannot be revoked automatically upon conviction, but must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, ensuring the justice system protects both liberty and public interest.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling established the foundation of modern <b>bail jurisprudence</b> in India, affirming that even a convicted person retains dignity and the right to judicial review. It has guided subsequent judgments to resist mechanical denials of bail and reinforced that restrictions on liberty must be grounded in substantial reasons.</p>\n\n<p>In simple terms, the decision balances <b>personal freedom</b> and <b>public safety</b>, favoring release unless compelling reasons demand custody. As Justice Krishna Iyer eloquently stated: \u201c<b>Bail is the rule and jail is the exception.</b>\u201d</p>",

    "description": "<p>The case of <b>Commander K.M. Nanavati v. State of Maharashtra</b> (1959) remains one of the most significant criminal trials in Indian jurisprudence, fundamentally altering perceptions of jury trials and the defense of provocation.</p>\n\n<p>Commander Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati, a distinguished officer of the Indian Navy, lived in Mumbai with his wife Sylvia and their children. When Sylvia\u2019s extramarital affair with Prem Ahuja, a wealthy businessman, came to light, Nanavati confronted them. In an emotionally charged encounter, he took his service revolver and went to Prem Ahuja\u2019s residence, where he fatally shot him.</p>\n\n<p>Key legal questions arose: whether Nanavati\u2019s act amounted to murder under <b>Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)</b>, and whether it could be reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder under <b>Exception 1 to Section 300 IPC</b> for grave and sudden provocation.</p>\n\n<p>At the Bombay Sessions Court, a jury trial returned a \u201cNot Guilty\u201d verdict by 8:1. The Sessions Judge, deeming the jury\u2019s decision perverse and influenced by media sympathy, referred the case to the Bombay High Court under <b>Section 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure</b>. The High Court reversed the jury\u2019s verdict, finding Nanavati guilty of murder\u2014a conviction later upheld by the Supreme Court of India.</p>\n\n<p>The courts examined whether provocation was truly sudden and overwhelming. Finding that Nanavati had time to plan\u2014retrieving his revolver and traveling to Ahuja\u2019s home\u2014the defense of sudden provocation was rejected. The case also exposed media influence on juries, leading to the abolition of jury trials in Indian criminal law during the 1960s.</p>\n\n<p>Nanavati served his sentence but was subsequently pardoned by the Governor of Maharashtra after significant public and political support. His story inspired numerous films, books, and debates, most famously the Bollywood movie <b>Rustom</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The <b>Nanavati case</b> stands as a milestone in Indian criminal law, clarifying the limits of the provocation defense, highlighting the vulnerabilities of jury-based trials, and prompting the end of the jury system in India.</p>",

    "title": "Cheque Bounce Recovery in India: Your Legal Options Explained",
    "description": "<p>In India, a <b>cheque bounce</b>, technically known as <b>dishonor of cheque</b>, is a criminal offense punishable under Section 138 of the <b>Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881</b>. This happens when a bank refuses to honor a cheque due to insufficient funds in the drawer's account, or for other reasons like signature mismatch. For an ordinary citizen, receiving a bounced cheque can be a frustrating experience, but it's crucial to understand the legal options available to recover the owed amount.</p>\n\n<p>The process for <b>cheque bounce recovery</b> begins with sending a legal notice to the issuer of the cheque. This notice must be sent within 30 days from the date the bank informs you about the dishonor of the cheque. The notice should demand payment of the cheque amount within 15 days. If the issuer fails to make the payment within this period, you have the right to file a criminal complaint in the court of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, within one month from the date of expiry of the 15-day notice period. This initiates legal proceedings under Section 138 of the <b>Negotiable Instruments Act</b>.</p>\n\n<p>A critical aspect of the <b>Section 138</b> case is establishing that the debt or liability exists. The onus is on the complainant to prove that the cheque was issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or other liability. The drawer of the cheque has the opportunity to defend themselves, and the court will consider both sides before delivering a judgment. If the court finds the accused guilty, they can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the criminal proceedings under Section 138, it's also possible to initiate a civil suit for recovery of money. While the criminal case aims to penalize the defaulter, a civil suit aims to recover the outstanding amount along with interest and other costs. Filing a civil suit doesn't preclude initiating criminal proceedings, and both can proceed simultaneously. The legal recourse available to an individual who receives a <b>bounced cheque</b> provides substantial protection, ensuring that financial transactions are honored and that remedies are available when defaults occur.</p>",

    "title": "Indian Landlord Rights: Eviction Rules You Need to Know",
    "description": "<p>In India, landlords have specific rights when it comes to evicting a tenant, governed primarily by the respective state's <b>Rent Control Act</b>. These Acts vary across states, but generally, a landlord cannot evict a tenant at will. A valid and legal ground for eviction must exist, such as non-payment of rent, causing nuisance, subletting without permission, or using the property for illegal activities. It's crucial for landlords to understand the specific provisions of the Rent Control Act applicable in their state to ensure any eviction process complies with the law.</p>\n\n<p>The process of eviction typically involves serving a legal notice to the tenant, clearly stating the reason for eviction and giving them a reasonable timeframe to vacate the premises. If the tenant fails to comply, the landlord can then file an eviction suit in the appropriate court. The court will then hear both sides of the argument, examining the evidence presented by both the landlord and the tenant. The burden of proof usually lies with the landlord to demonstrate that a valid ground for eviction exists under the relevant <b>Rent Control Act</b>. Landlords must keep accurate records of rent payments, communication with the tenant, and any violations of the rental agreement to support their case.</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that even with a valid reason for eviction, a landlord cannot use force or illegal means to evict a tenant. Such actions can result in legal repercussions for the landlord, including penalties and damages. The eviction process must be carried out through the court, obtaining a court order for eviction if necessary. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of following due process of law in eviction matters. For example, the landmark case of *Raghunath G. Panhale (Dead) By Lrs. v. M/S. Chaganlal Sundarji And Co* highlighted the need for strict adherence to procedural laws in eviction proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>For ordinary citizens who are landlords, understanding these <b>eviction rules</b> is crucial for protecting their property rights while also acting within the bounds of the law. Seeking legal advice from a lawyer specializing in property law is highly recommended before initiating any eviction proceedings. This ensures compliance with the state's specific Rent Control Act and minimizes the risk of legal complications. Moreover, familiarizing oneself with relevant case laws can provide a better understanding of how courts interpret and apply these laws in practice. Remember that a fair and legal eviction process protects both the landlord's rights and the tenant's rights, promoting a more equitable rental relationship.</p>",

    "title": "Online Fraud Refund: Your Rights Under Indian Law",
    "description": "<p>If you've fallen victim to <b>online fraud</b> in India, knowing your rights concerning a <b>refund</b> is crucial. Indian law provides avenues for recovering lost funds, though the process can sometimes be complex. The primary legislation governing such issues is the <b>Information Technology Act, 2000</b>, which addresses cybercrimes and provides a framework for holding fraudsters accountable. Banks and payment service providers also have a responsibility to ensure secure transactions, and their negligence can lead to liability.</p>\n\n<p>The liability of banks in cases of <b>unauthorized electronic transactions</b> is often governed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines. These guidelines typically differentiate liability based on customer reporting timelines. If the customer reports the fraudulent transaction promptly (usually within 3 days), the liability is often limited or even zero. Delay in reporting can increase the customer's potential liability. Banks are required to have a robust dispute resolution mechanism to handle customer complaints regarding fraudulent transactions and provide a refund, if warranted. It is important to document all communications with the bank and file a formal complaint with evidence of the <b>fraudulent transaction</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond banking regulations, Section 43 of the <b>IT Act</b> deals with compensation for damages caused to computer systems and networks due to unauthorized access or disruption. While it may not directly guarantee a <b>refund</b>, it allows for claiming damages. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the <b>online fraud</b>, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) provisions related to cheating, forgery, and criminal breach of trust can also be invoked. Registering a First Information Report (FIR) with the police is a crucial step in initiating a criminal investigation and strengthens your case for seeking legal remedies.</p>\n\n<p>For ordinary citizens, the practical implication is to be vigilant and proactive. Immediately report any <b>online fraud</b> to your bank and the cybercrime cell. Keep records of all transactions and communication. File a police complaint to initiate formal investigation. Familiarizing yourself with RBI guidelines on limiting liability in fraudulent transactions can greatly help navigate the process of claiming a <b>refund</b>. Remember, acting quickly and diligently is essential to maximizing your chances of recovering your funds.</p>",

    "title": "Live-in Relationships in India: Know Your Legal Rights",
    "description": "<p>In India, a <b>live-in relationship</b> refers to an arrangement where two individuals choose to cohabit and share their lives together without being legally married. This form of relationship has gained increasing social acceptance, and the Indian legal system has gradually recognized certain rights and protections for couples in such arrangements. However, it's crucial to understand that live-in relationships don't automatically grant the same rights as a marriage. Proof of a relationship resembling marriage, including factors like duration, shared household, pooling of resources, and intent to marry, is often essential for claiming legal entitlements.</p>\n\n<p>Several landmark court judgments have shaped the legal landscape surrounding live-in relationships. The Supreme Court, in cases like D. Patchaiammal v. D. Velusamy, has laid down guidelines for determining the validity and nature of a live-in relationship. To be considered a valid relationship warranting legal protection, the couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses. Importantly, not all cohabitation qualifies as a live-in relationship entitled to legal rights. The court has emphasized the necessity of a long-standing and genuine relationship similar to marriage. These judicial pronouncements primarily aim to prevent exploitation and protect vulnerable partners within such arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>The legal implications for women in <b>live-in relationships</b> are particularly significant. While not explicitly covered under the Hindu Marriage Act, certain legislations like the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, provide some recourse. This Act recognizes women in live-in relationships as being in a relationship \"in the nature of marriage,\" thereby entitling them to protection from domestic violence, including physical, emotional, and economic abuse. They can seek remedies such as residence orders, monetary relief, and protection orders under this Act. Further, children born out of live-in relationships are considered legitimate and have inheritance rights in their parents\u2019 property, as established by various court decisions.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that establishing legal rights within a <b>live-in relationship</b> can often be challenging. Unlike a formal marriage certificate, there's no single document that automatically proves the existence of the relationship or its nature. Individuals need to gather evidence, such as joint bank accounts, utility bills with both names, photographs, and testimonies of friends and family, to demonstrate the validity and characteristics of their relationship to the court. Seeking legal advice from a qualified lawyer is highly recommended for individuals in live-in relationships to understand their rights and obligations and to navigate the legal complexities effectively. This is especially crucial in cases involving property disputes, maintenance claims, or inheritance matters.</p>",
