    "title": "Finality of Section 11 Determinations under the Pre-2015 Arbitration Regime: Supreme Court Reaffirms Res Judicata Principles",
    "description": "<p>In a significant ruling, the Supreme Court of India, in *M/s Eminent Colonizers Private Limited v. Rajasthan Housing Board*, affirmed the binding and conclusive nature of judicial determinations made under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, specifically for proceedings initiated prior to the 2015 amendment. The judgment clarifies that once the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement are implicitly or expressly determined at the Section 11 stage, this issue cannot be reopened in subsequent Section 34 proceedings, due to the doctrine of *res judicata*.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from construction contracts where M/s Eminent Colonizers Private Limited (Appellant) sought the appointment of an arbitrator under Section 11 of the pre-2015 Act. The High Court appointed a sole arbitrator, an order which the Respondent, Rajasthan Housing Board, did not challenge. Following arbitral awards in favor of the Appellant, the Respondent filed Section 34 applications, primarily contending that the relevant contractual clause did not constitute a valid arbitration agreement. The Commercial Court and High Court concurred with the Respondent, setting aside the awards, leading to the appeal before the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court emphasized that arbitral proceedings were governed by the pre-2015 legal position, adhering to the principles laid down in *SBP & Co. v. Patel Engineering Ltd.* This precedent established that Section 11 powers are judicial, requiring a conclusive determination of a valid arbitration agreement, which attains finality under Section 11(7). The Court reasoned that the High Court's act of appointing an arbitrator implicitly confirmed the existence of a valid agreement, and the Respondent's failure to challenge this order made it final.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, the Court clarified the distinction between *precedent* (operating *in rem*) and *res judicata* (operating *in personam*). It held that even if the Section 11 order lacked detailed reasoning, it operated as *res judicata* between the specific parties, precluding re-examination of the same issue. This position differs from the post-2015 regime under Section 11(6A), where the court\u2019s inquiry is confined to a *prima facie* examination, leaving deeper issues to the arbitral tribunal.</p>\n\n<p>Allowing the appeals, the Supreme Court ruled that the lower courts erred in re-examining the arbitration agreement's validity. The issue was concluded by *res judicata*, making the setting aside of awards on that ground unsustainable. The matter was remitted for consideration of other Section 34 objections, excluding the now-finalized issue of the arbitration agreement's existence and validity. This judgment reinforces procedural finality, judicial coherence, and the integrity of arbitration under the pre-2015 regime, highlighting the necessity of promptly challenging Section 11 orders.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha has petitioned the Bombay High Court to safeguard his personality and publicity rights from unauthorized commercial exploitation. He seeks protection for distinct attributes like his name, voice, signature phrase \"Khamosh,\" image, likeness, caricature, and signature, asserting their commercial value and strong association with his identity over decades.</p>\n\n<p>Sinha's plea details the extensive misuse of his persona, including the creation of AI-generated images designed to ridicule him, memes, GIFs, fake social media accounts, and the unauthorized sale of merchandise such as posters and t-shirts. These activities not only deceive the public into believing his endorsement but also inflict reputational damage.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, the High Court questioned the maintainability of a commercial IP action based on personality rights. In response, Sinha's legal team argued that these rights are independently enforceable under common law principles like \"passing off,\" fundamental rights (Articles 19(1)(a) and 21, encompassing the right to privacy), and Section 38B of the Copyright Act, 1957, which protects performers' moral rights against distortion. Satisfied with these submissions, the Court has reserved the matter for its orders.</p>",

    "title": "Enforcement of Retiral Benefits and Salary Arrears in Contempt Jurisdiction",
    "description": "<p>The Allahabad High Court, in Contempt Application (Civil) No. 2193 of 2025, unequivocally affirmed that timely disbursement of retiral dues and salary arrears is a legally enforceable right, not subject to administrative discretion. This decision arose from the U.P. State Employees Welfare Corporation's failure to comply with earlier judicial directives, despite the applicant's entitlement being upheld after the Corporation's appeal was dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>The Court scrutinized a personal affidavit filed by the Corporation's Executive Director, finding it inaccurate and incomplete, specifically regarding outstanding salary arrears. Furthermore, the Court identified impermissible deductions totaling \u20b94,55,100.38 from the applicant's retiral dues, which included amounts for \"Prostsahan Agrim,\" \"Tyohar Agrim,\" and GST recovery. The Court ruled that these deductions lacked statutory authority, emphasizing that retiral benefits are vested entitlements that cannot be reduced or withheld arbitrarily. Concerns were also raised about the non-disbursement of state-provided financial assistance intended for these payments.</p>\n\n<p>In response, the Court granted the Executive Director a final one-month period to clear all retiral dues without deductions and fully pay the salary arrears, warning of contempt charges for non-compliance. Additionally, the Principal Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies, Uttar Pradesh, was directed to investigate the reasons for the continued non-payment despite judicial orders and report on actions taken against defaulting officers. This judgment underscores the critical importance of individual and institutional accountability in public administration, reinforcing that public authorities are legally bound to implement judicial directions promptly and in strict accordance with the law.</p>",

    "title": "Roopam Kumar v. SBI Cards & Payment Services: Bank\u2019s Liability for Unauthorized Electronic Transactions",
    "description": "<p>The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chandigarh, delivered a pivotal judgment in Roopam Kumar v. SBI Cards & Payment Services Private Limited, reinforcing banks' stringent obligations against unauthorized electronic transactions. The February 6, 2026 decision highlights financial institutions' accountability under RBI regulations.</p>\n\n<p>Roopam Kumar's SBI credit card incurred two suspicious transactions totaling Rs. 10,999 in December 2017. She promptly reported the fraud, leading to her card's immediate blocking. Despite diligent efforts, including reporting to police and the Banking Ombudsman, SBI failed to investigate, reported her as a CIBIL defaulter, and later demanded Rs. 35,594 for the disputed amounts. She paid under protest and approached the Commission.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission relied on RBI Circular No. RBI/2017-18/15 (\"Customer Protection \u2013 Limiting Liability of Customers...\"). This framework dictates \"zero liability\" for customers in cases of bank fraud/negligence or third-party breaches (if reported within three working days). Crucially, it places the burden of proving customer liability on the bank and mandates complaint resolution within 90 days and shadow reversal of disputed amounts within ten working days.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on precedents, the Commission directed SBI to refund Rs. 35,594 with 9% annual interest, remove the complainant's name from CIBIL defaulter lists, and pay Rs. 10,000 compensation for harassment and litigation costs.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment significantly impacts the banking sector, affirming that RBI circulars are binding, and non-compliance constitutes a deficiency in service. It reinforces banks' strict liability, acknowledges information asymmetry, and underscores their duty to maintain robust security and grievance redressal mechanisms for consumer protection.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Karnataka Government has published the draft Good Samaritan and Medical Professional (Protection and Regulation During Emergency Situations) Rules, 2026, under the 2018 Act. This significant step, superseding an earlier version, aims to enhance emergency medical care and protect Good Samaritans. A 15-day public consultation period is open for suggestions on these rules, which also clarify definitions consistent with the parent Act for robust interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>The framework designates the Deputy Commissioner of the Revenue District as the authority for receiving complaints and ensuring disciplinary action for non-compliance, following existing police disciplinary rules. It establishes a robust Good Samaritan Fund, financed by diverse sources including public donations, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds, contributions from registered entities, government grants (e.g., Karnataka Road Safety Authority), and eligible loans, ensuring a sustainable financial base.</p>\n\n<p>A critical hospital reimbursement mechanism is outlined, allowing hospitals unable to recover costs to claim expenses from the Suvarna Arogya Suraksha Trust (SAST) within one month. SAST reimburses empanelled hospitals at full scheme rates (Ayushman Bharath Arogya Karnataka - ABArK) and non-empanelled ones at ABArK or Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) rates, whichever is higher. An Expert Committee determines rates for procedures not included in the Health Benefit Package. Hospitals can appeal reimbursement decisions to the Commissioner, Health and Family Welfare. Additionally, Good Samaritans appearing as witnesses can claim travel and daily expenses from the fund.</p>\n\n<p>The rules define clear authority structures, designating the Deputy Commissioner as both the Appropriate and Complaining Authority, and the Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary of Health and Family Welfare as the Appellate Authority. Financial accountability is ensured through mandated annual reports by the Commissioner and meticulous maintenance of various books of accounts, adhering to established financial regulations. Furthermore, an annual recognition system for Good Samaritans is established, with awards presented on Republic Day, aiming to encourage humanitarian acts. This comprehensive framework balances the protection and encouragement of emergency assistance with robust regulatory oversight and financial sustainability.</p>",

    "title": "Supreme Court Reaffirms Pro-Arbitration Interpretation on Post-Award Extension of Arbitral Mandate under Section 29A",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court, in C. Velusamy v. K. Indhera, clarified that a court can extend an arbitrator's mandate under Section 29A(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, even after the statutory period has expired and a delayed arbitral award has been rendered. This ruling reinterprets Section 29A, initially designed to ensure timely arbitral awards, preventing procedural delays from defeating the arbitration process itself.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from an arbitrator delivering an award in May 2024, after the extended mandate had expired in February 2024. The Madras High Court had previously dismissed an application for mandate extension, deeming an award passed after expiry of mandate a nullity. The principal issue before the Supreme Court was whether an application for extension is maintainable post-award.</p>\n\n<p>Overturning the High Court's decision, the Supreme Court emphasized that Section 29A aims to preserve, not abort, arbitral proceedings. It found no express prohibition against entertaining post-award extension applications within Section 29A. The Court distinguished a delayed award as \"unenforceable\" under Section 36, rather than \"void\" or \"non est,\" asserting that the arbitrator's procedural lapse does not curtail the court's independent power to extend the mandate.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment marks a significant departure from rigid interpretations, ensuring judicial oversight survives mandate expiry and delayed awards. The Court's pro-arbitration stance prevents automatic annulment of proceedings on technicalities. When granting extensions, courts may impose costs, reduce arbitrator fees, substitute arbitrators, or set other conditions. The decision reinforces Section 29A as a facilitative mechanism for securing the meaningful conclusion of arbitration.</p>",

    "title": "Gujarat High Court Affirms Exclusivity of DRT Jurisdiction Under SARFAESI Act: A Critical Analysis of Varun Procon Pvt. Ltd. v. State Bank of India",
    "description": "<p>The Gujarat High Court, in Varun Procon Pvt. Ltd. v. State Bank of India (January 9, 2026), unequivocally affirmed the Debt Recovery Tribunal's (DRT) exclusive jurisdiction under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act). This landmark judgment clarifies the expansive reach of Section 34's jurisdictional bar on Civil Courts and the comprehensive powers vested in the DRT under Section 17.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a challenge by Varun Procon, a corporate guarantor, to a mortgage deed in Civil Court. The guarantor alleged fraud and lack of proper corporate authorization, seeking an injunction against the State Bank of India. This civil suit was notably filed after the Bank had initiated recovery proceedings before the DRT under the RDDB Act and issued a SARFAESI Section 13(2) notice. The injunction application in the civil suit remained dormant for nearly nine years, only to be revived by the appellants after the Bank obtained a Section 14 order for physical possession of the secured assets.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court dismissed the appeal, asserting that a corporate guarantor falls squarely within the definition of \"borrower\" under Section 2(f) of SARFAESI. It firmly held that Section 34 expressly bars Civil Courts from granting injunctions against measures taken under the SARFAESI Act, particularly a Section 14 possession order. The Court elucidated that the DRT, under Section 17, possesses full authority to adjudicate all grievances, including the validity of the security interest itself and compliance with corporate authorization requirements, as these are incidental to determining the legality of SARFAESI actions. The Court distinguished the Supreme Court's Central Bank of India v. Prabha Jain decision, noting it involved a post-sale challenge, unlike the pre-possession challenge in the instant case. Furthermore, the High Court rejected arguments that allegations of fraud could circumvent DRT jurisdiction, deeming such claims, when essentially challenging security enforcement, to fall within the specialized tribunal's purview. The Court also condemned the appellants' dilatory tactics, highlighting the prolonged dormancy of the civil suit.</p>\n\n<p>This definitive ruling reinforces the SARFAESI Act's legislative intent to establish a streamlined, efficient, and exclusive recovery mechanism, preventing fragmentation of the recovery process. It strengthens the position of secured creditors by limiting jurisdictional circumvention through civil suits, even under the guise of fraud, and ensures that disputes concerning the validity of security interests are handled by the specialized tribunals best equipped for such matters.</p>",

    "title": "Balancing Environmental Protection with Procedural Justice: Supreme Court\u2019s Landmark Ruling on Forest Encroachment Evictions in Assam",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court, in Abdul Khalek & Others v. The State of Assam & Others, delivered a landmark judgment harmonizing environmental protection with procedural justice regarding evictions from reserved forests in Assam. The case arose from eviction notices issued by the Assam Forest Department to villagers claiming decades of habitation within formally notified reserved forests. The State contended significant encroachment (19.92% of forest area), causing severe ecological degradation and necessitating action under constitutional obligations (Articles 48A, 51A(g)).</p>\n\n<p>The Court affirmed the paramount importance of forest conservation but unequivocally stated that environmental protection must be pursued through lawful means, rejecting arbitrary action even under urgent circumstances. It emphasized that the Constitution demands both environmental imperatives and the rule of law coexist and reinforce each other, ensuring due process and natural justice.</p>\n\n<p>In response to the Court's concerns, the State proposed, and the Court approved, a comprehensive procedural framework. This mechanism mandates a committee (forest and revenue officials) to issue notices, granting alleged occupants an opportunity to present evidence of their rights. If unauthorized occupation of reserved forest land is confirmed, a reasoned \"speaking order\" must be served, followed by a 15-day notice period before physical eviction. The framework also recognizes legitimate habitation under the Assam Panchayat Act (forest villages with Jamabandi Register entries) and the Forest Rights Act, 2006, ensuring these rights are protected.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court directed the maintenance of status quo until this process is completed, allowing all contentions to be raised before the committee. This ruling reaffirms the State's duty to protect forests while establishing that administrative actions must conform to fairness, reasonableness, and due process. It provides a model for addressing complex forest encroachment challenges sustainably, ensuring legitimate governance and public confidence.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) introduced significant reforms in February 2026 to address the persistent challenge of credit access for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in India. The \"Lending to MSME Sector (Amendment) Directions, 2026\" fundamentally shifts the lending paradigm from asset-backed security to business viability and repayment capacity.</p>\n\n<p>The most critical reform prohibits banks from demanding collateral security for loans up to \u20b920 lakh granted to Micro and Small Enterprises. This binding rule aims to empower entrepreneurs who lack property or substantial assets, ensuring their business plans are evaluated on merit. The amendment further strengthens support for government-backed initiatives by guaranteeing collateral-free loans up to \u20b920 lakh for beneficiaries of the Prime Minister Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, banks are allowed flexibility to extend collateral-free loans up to \u20b925 lakh for borrowers demonstrating strong financial standing and good repayment history, subject to internal policies. To mitigate increased risk for banks, the RBI permits them to leverage existing credit guarantee coverage for MSE financing. While banks cannot compel security, borrowers retain the autonomy to offer voluntary collateral (e.g., gold) for potentially better terms.</p>\n\n<p>These new norms apply prospectively to loans sanctioned or renewed on or after April 1, 2026. This structural shift reorients MSME lending from gatekeeping based on asset ownership to evaluation based on entrepreneurial ability and performance, a crucial development for India's small business ecosystem.</p>",

Barnali Mukherjee & Anr., clarified that disputes where the very existence of an arbitration agreement is alleged to be founded on a forged document are generally non-arbitrable. The decision reinforces the fundamental principle that arbitration is premised on demonstrable consent.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from a partnership where Rajia Begum claimed induction via a \"Deed of Admission and Retirement,\" which contained an arbitration clause. Barnali Mukherjee categorically denied the deed's genuineness, alleging forgery and fabrication. While lower courts rejected arbitration citing serious fraud and non-production of the original deed, the High Court, under Article 227, referred the Section 8 application to arbitration. Concurrently, it correctly refused to appoint an arbitrator under Section 11 due to the disputed agreement.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court, reviewing precedents, reaffirmed that fraud going to the root of the arbitration agreement itself renders the dispute non-arbitrable, requiring judicial determination as a jurisdictional question. It distinguished this from allegations of fraud related to contractual performance, which may be arbitrable. The Court found several inconsistencies casting serious doubt on the Admission Deed's authenticity, including its late appearance, lack of contemporaneous records, and non-production of the original.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the Supreme Court held that allegations of forgery strike at the very root of arbitral jurisdiction. It ruled that the High Court erred in overturning concurrent factual findings under its supervisory Article 227 jurisdiction. The Court set aside the High Court's order referring the dispute to arbitration under Section 8 and affirmed its decision to reject the Section 11 application for arbitrator appointment. This judgment emphasizes that courts must first determine the validity of the arbitration agreement when its existence is seriously challenged, safeguarding the integrity of arbitral jurisdiction and the essential role of consent.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Kerala High Court, in Sibin S.V. v. State of Kerala, delivered a significant judgment clarifying the legal boundaries of teachers' disciplinary authority and criminal liability. The case stemmed from a teacher, Sibin S.V., allegedly beating a student with a cane, leading to charges under Section 118(1) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons, and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act (JJ Act) for cruelty to children.</p>\n\n<p>The Court dismissed the BNS 118(1) charge, ruling that a cane is not a \"dangerous weapon\" as contemplated by the statute, lacking the enumerated lethal characteristics. Regarding the JJ Act charge, the Court noted the three-day delay in filing the FIR and crucially, the absence of any external injuries on the child during medical examination. The High Court concluded that the petitioner had used minimal corporal punishment solely for discipline, without any malicious intent to cause harm or cruelty.</p>\n\n<p>Emphasizing jurisprudential precedents, the judgment affirmed that teachers possess an implied authority, derived from parental consent, to enforce reasonable and proportionate discipline for students' character and conduct improvement. Such bona fide acts, free from malice or excessive force, fall within the general exceptions to criminal liability (Sections 88 and 89 of the BNS). While cautioning against unwieldy or emotional attacks, the Court held that legitimate, controlled disciplinary measures are protected. Consequently, the High Court quashed all criminal proceedings against the teacher, deeming their continuation unproductive in light of the circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling provides crucial guidance, balancing the imperative of child protection with the practical necessities of school discipline and acknowledging the teacher\u2019s distinctive role in character formation. It distinguishes legitimate disciplinary actions from criminal conduct, ensuring that child protection goals do not inadvertently undermine essential mechanisms of socialization in educational institutions.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Ankhim Holdings Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Zaveri Construction Pvt. Ltd., delivered a pivotal judgment clarifying the interplay between arbitration and insolvency law. The Court unequivocally ruled that a High Court, while exercising its power under Section 15(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act to appoint a substitute arbitrator, cannot declare prior arbitral proceedings a \"nullity\" simply because they were conducted during an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) moratorium.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from a redevelopment project where arbitration was invoked. Subsequently, Zaveri Construction entered Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), triggering an IBC moratorium, yet arbitration continued. After the original arbitrator terminated proceedings, the appellants sought a substitute. The Bombay High Court, while appointing a new arbitrator, also declared the earlier arbitral proceedings, conducted during the moratorium, null and void.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court overturned this declaration, emphasizing that Section 15 of the Arbitration Act confers limited jurisdiction focused on termination and substitution, with the legislative intent being continuity, not disruption. The Court highlighted that the Arbitration Act is a self-contained code, and courts cannot exceed its prescribed boundaries to invent new procedures or collaterally review the validity of prior proceedings. The High Court's action constituted an overreach, compromising the speedy dispute resolution objective by potentially forcing a de novo restart.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, recognizing that certain third-party flat sales had occurred based on arbitral orders, the Supreme Court invoked its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to validate these transactions, preventing injustice to innocent parties. This landmark ruling reinforces India's pro-arbitration stance, underscores the principle of minimal judicial interference, and ensures commercial certainty. It harmonizes the IBC moratorium \u2013 which restricts the initiation or continuation of claims against a corporate debtor \u2013 with the procedural continuity of arbitration, without allowing one regime to procedurally override the other through judicial expansion. This judgment sets a crucial precedent for jurisdictional boundaries and procedural consistency in complex commercial disputes intersecting arbitration and insolvency.</p>",

This ruling underscores the judiciary's vital role in safeguarding intellectual property and consumer trust amidst the growing misuse of established brand identities in the digital economy.</p>\n\n<p>Fraudsters exploited Delhivery's significant brand goodwill and recognition as a leading logistics provider by using identical or deceptively similar marks to solicit money through sham franchise offers and delivery service proposals.

This ruling originated from the case of Rumaisa Arwa, a Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery student, who was denied examination eligibility due to an attendance shortfall caused by pregnancy and childbirth. Her college's rigid 75% attendance policy, offering only a minimal 10% relaxation, effectively stalled her academic journey.</p>\n\n<p>The Court asserted that pregnancy and marriage are natural life events that must not obstruct women's access to higher education. Drawing upon a Delhi High Court precedent, it highlighted how institutional policies lacking adequate maternity provisions discriminate against female students, contradicting principles of gender equality and educational accessibility. The judgment also underscored a failure by educational institutions to align with University Grants Commission directives on maternity and childcare support.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond providing individual relief by mandating Arwa's examination participation and the declaration of her results, the Court advocated for comprehensive support systems. These include additional classes, specialized study materials, and flexible assessment mechanisms for new mothers. This landmark decision urges educational institutions nationwide to reassess their policies through a gender-sensitive lens, implementing robust maternity support frameworks\u2014such as flexible attendance and alternative assessment methods\u2014to ensure academic excellence and maternal responsibilities are not mutually exclusive.

This dual regulation means cross-border investments must comply with Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) frameworks, including sectoral caps and pricing guidelines, ensuring the ecosystem is \"open, but not frictionless.\"</p>\n\n<p>Comparatively, India's regime contrasts with Singapore's facilitative Variable Capital Company (VCC) model, which prioritizes domicile flexibility, and the United States' disclosure-based private fund system. India's approach emphasizes formal compliance and registration, demanding deeper regulatory navigation from global VCs.</p>\n\n<p>At the transaction level, private contracts derive enforceability from adherence to company law and foreign exchange restrictions. Exits remain \"structurally regulated\" through IPOs, M&A, secondary transfers, and buybacks, making exit planning a critical, front-end legal exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Looking ahead, especially in sectors like AI and Fintech, regulatory compliance is becoming an upstream valuation variable. Future success will rely on anticipatory compliance with evolving sectoral regulations, data governance norms, and \"controlled innovation\" frameworks like RBI's Regulatory Sandbox. The next era of Indian venture growth will belong to those who can lawfully structure, credibly govern, and predictably exit investments within this unique, hybrid regulatory environment.</p>",

    "title": "Reimagining Compensation Under The Motor Vehicles Act: Allahabad High Court Holds Permanently Disabled Minor Entitled To Wages Of A Skilled Workman",
    "description": "<p>The Allahabad High Court, in Sangam Lal v. The New India Assurance Co. Ltd., has delivered a significant judgment under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, reaffirming the principle of \"just compensation\" for accident victims. The court ruled that a minor suffering 100% permanent functional disability is entitled to compensation calculated based on the minimum wages of a skilled workman, irrespective of their age or employment status at the time of the accident. This decision strengthens the protective framework for permanently disabled minors and child victims.</p>\n\n<p>The case involved Sangam Lal, who, at 16, suffered devastating injuries including leg amputation in a 2009 motor accident, rendering him completely unable to perform physical labor. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) initially awarded Rs. 5,03,310, assessing 80% functional disability and failing to include future prospects. Both the claimant and the insurer appealed.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Sandeep Jain, speaking for the High Court, clearly distinguished medical from functional disability, determining that the claimant had suffered 100% functional disability given his physical work background and the nature of his injuries. Crucially, the court recognized the minor as a \"skilled workman\" for compensation purposes, citing Supreme Court precedents, thus rejecting the insurer's arguments related to the claimant's age or lack of formal employment. The court also corrected the multiplier from 16 to 18, and awarded 50% for future prospects, acknowledging the potential for progress in the life of a living victim. Non-pecuniary damages for pain, suffering, and loss of amenities were significantly enhanced.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the High Court increased the total compensation to Rs. 16,59,510, along with 7% interest. This ruling establishes a vital precedent, affirming that compensation must genuinely reflect the impact of disability on a victim's life and future earning capacity, with functional disability, rather than technicalities, guiding the assessment.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court, in M/s Riar Builders Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. v. Union of India & Ors., has flagged significant structural inequities in the National Highways Act, 1956 (NH Act), concerning land acquisition compensation. Landowners under the NH Act face procedural and remedial disadvantages compared to those whose land is acquired under general statutes like the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, or the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.</p>\n\n<p>The Court highlighted that under the NH Act, compensation is initially determined by an executive authority. Dissatisfied landowners are limited to mandatory arbitration, typically conducted by administrative officers (e.g., District Collector) who often lack the judicial experience needed for complex valuation issues, thereby blurring the separation of powers. Further, judicial review of these arbitral awards is highly restricted under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, preventing comprehensive re-evaluation of evidence or market value, unlike the multi-tiered judicial scrutiny available under older laws or the enhanced safeguards (e.g., fair market value, solatium, appellate review) of the 2013 Act.</p>\n\n<p>This disparity creates unequal treatment without an \"intelligible differentia,\" raising serious constitutional questions under Article 300A. While acknowledging the imperative of rapid infrastructure development, the Court emphasized that this goal should not compromise fairness and equality. The Supreme Court, exercising institutional restraint, refrained from striking down the NH Act's provisions. Instead, it used its extraordinary powers under Article 142 to rectify past procedural injustices and issued a clear constitutional signal, urging the Union Government to revisit the legislative framework to ensure parity, fairness, and robust judicial oversight.</p>",

    "title": "From Vodafone To Tiger Global \u2014 A Constitutional Reset",
    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court's Tiger Global ruling significantly reshapes Indian international tax jurisprudence, marking a decisive shift from the form-based approach of the Vodafone era to a substance-driven, value-based, and source-centric framework. For over a decade, Vodafone had entrenched the primacy of legal form, situs of shares, and treaty protection in offshore exit transactions, effectively enabling large-scale, tax-free capital gains on India-centric businesses.</p>\n\n<p>The Tiger Global case arose from foreign investors' exit from Flipkart via offshore entities, claiming tax exemption based on the situs of shares and treaty relief, despite the overwhelming operational and value creation base being in India. The Revenue contended these were indirect transfers of Indian assets, designed to avoid tax. The Court rejected the assessees' formalistic defense, ruling that the offshore share transfer amounted to an indirect transfer of Indian assets and was chargeable to tax in India. It held that interposed offshore structures lacking commercial substance could be disregarded, and treaty protection denied under anti-abuse principles.</p>\n\n<p>This judgment introduces several core doctrinal shifts. It rejects the rigid situs-based approach, prioritizing economic nexus, value creation, and the market where opportunities are exploited. It departs from the corporate separateness doctrine, subordinating form to economic reality and allowing entities lacking independent commercial purpose to be disregarded. Furthermore, it recalibrates treaty interpretation, making protection conditional on commercial legitimacy and the absence of abuse, thereby aligning Indian jurisprudence with post-BEPS international norms. The Court decisively embraced the \"look-through\" doctrine for exit taxation.</p>\n\n<p>Practically, the ruling signals the end of the \"Vodafone model\" for exit structuring, which routed investments through tax-favorable offshore jurisdictions to avoid Indian capital gains. It consolidates statutory anti-avoidance regimes like Explanation 5 to Section 9(1)(i) and GAAR into constitutional doctrine. Future cross-border tax planning in India must now align with genuine operational substance, managerial control, and value creation, moving away from artificial holding structures. This positions India as a sovereign market jurisdiction where tax outcomes follow economic reality, protecting commerce over contrivance.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Punjab and Haryana High Court's ruling in Vijay Kumar Dhawan v. Gurpreet Singh reaffirms the delicate balance between criminal law and medical negligence, specifically concerning criminal prosecution of doctors under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code. The judgment reinforces the critical safeguards outlined in Jacob Mathew v. State of Punjab, which prevent the mechanical initiation of criminal proceedings against medical professionals without credible medical opinion. The High Court utilized its inherent powers under Section 482 CrPC to prevent abuse of the judicial process.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from a private complaint after a tragic maternal death following childbirth at Dhawan Nursing Home. The complainant alleged his wife died due to improper surgery and subsequent infection. A Judicial Magistrate subsequently issued summons against the doctors, prompting the petitioners to seek quashing of the complaint and all consequential proceedings.</p>\n\n<p>The petitioners contended that there was no medical evidence attributing negligence. A senior medical professional testified to natural complications, and an independent inquiry by a Civil Surgeon's team had found no lapse. The High Court, emphasizing Jacob Mathew, reiterated that criminal liability under Section 304-A IPC requires gross negligence, not merely an error of judgment or an unfortunate outcome. The Court observed that the Magistrate had issued summons without adverting to these crucial medical opinions or obtaining an independent one, thus failing to distinguish between medical complications and criminal negligence as mandated by Supreme Court jurisprudence.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the High Court allowed the petition, quashing the criminal complaint and the summoning order. The court found that the evidence on record did not disclose a prima facie case of criminal negligence and that continuing the proceedings would constitute an abuse of the law. This ruling highlights the necessity for a higher threshold of proof in criminal culpability within complex medical fields, safeguarding the medical profession while upholding the integrity of the justice system.</p>",

Petitioner Versha Technotrade (L-3) alleged that M/s Allied Construction (L-1) and M/s Pooja Associates (L-2) formed an undisclosed cartel, citing a shared site inspection photograph and their frequent joint participation in past tenders for an EPC-mode Circuit House at Udalguri.</p>\n\n<p>Justice Sanjay Kumar Medhi found no prohibition on simultaneous site visits, and both L-1 and L-2 had executed independent Integrity Agreements. The Court noted that previous joint bidding indicated competition, not collusion. Crucially, the departmental affidavit confirmed no evidence of price coordination or restricted competitiveness. Rejecting inferential conclusions, the Court ruled that the interim stay had been obtained on a factual premise later abandoned, emphasizing that the burden of proving cartelization rests heavily on the accuser.</p>\n\n<p>The writ petition was dismissed, vacating the interim order and allowing the tender to proceed with Allied Construction.

Bollywood, a star-driven industry known for adapting international stories, life rights, and books, has historically faced criticism for unauthorized adaptations and complex intellectual property disputes. Its music rights landscape is contentious, often involving multiple labels and composers, leading to prolonged litigation. Contractual conflicts over remuneration and exclusivity, often lacking standardized agreements, frequently escalate to formal courts, establishing precedents but causing significant delays.</p>\n\n<p>The South Industry, conversely, prioritizes original, culturally rooted, hero-centric narratives and regional remakes. It emphasizes proper IP licensing, as seen with franchises like Baahubali, and features a more streamlined music rights environment with fewer dominant labels. Its tighter producer-actor networks, often rooted in regional connections, facilitate internal mediation through bodies like the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce, leading to faster, industry-specific resolutions that prioritize preserving professional relationships over lengthy court battles.</p>\n\n<p>Both industries confront the complexities of digital platforms, battling persistent piracy, territorial licensing disputes, and ownership conflicts with streaming services. While Bollywood's reliance on formal legal processes offers rigor and establishes valuable precedents, Tollywood's emphasis on arbitration and industry-mediated settlements provides speed and flexibility. Ultimately, success lies in combining these strengths\u2014the rigor of formal processes with the efficiency of internal mediation\u2014to prevent disputes, safeguard creative work, and ensure fair compensation in an evolving global and digital landscape.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Delhi High Court recently ruled that a husband's obligation to maintain his wife and minor child is not diminished by shared custody arrangements. This significant judgment clarifies that maintenance is a statutory right, rooted in dignity and dependency, distinct from custodial agreements, and reinforces a settled principle often misunderstood in family law.</p>\n\n<p>The case arose from a husband appealing an interim maintenance order, arguing his liability should be reduced as he bore expenses for one child in his custody, while the other resided with the mother. The Court rejected this plea, affirming that incurring costs for one child does not absolve his duty to support the wife and the other dependent child. It upheld the order, directing him to pay \u20b917,500 per month.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's reasoning emphasized that maintenance under Section 125 CrPC is a statutory duty to prevent destitution and ensure dignity, not a negotiable benefit. It clearly distinguished custody, governing physical care, from maintenance, addressing financial dependency, asserting they cannot be conflated. Shared custody does not imply equal financial capacity or justify a mechanical division of maintenance, which must instead be determined through a holistic assessment of earning capacity, resources, and actual dependency. Crucially, a child's right to maintenance was recognized as independent and paramount, irrespective of custodial arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>This ruling has crucial implications, preventing the misuse of shared custody as a ground to reduce or avoid maintenance and providing clear guidance to Family Courts. It reinforces that financial support is based on need and capacity, not \"custodial arithmetic,\" thereby strengthening financial protection for dependent spouses and children. The judgment underscores that maintenance law is a safeguard for welfare and social justice, not a negotiable liability subject to private calculations.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Kerala High Court, in a significant judgment in Actor Mohanlal Vishwanath vs. State of Kerala and Anr., clarified that celebrity endorsers cannot be automatically held liable in consumer complaints alleging unfair trade practices or deficiency of service solely based on their appearance in advertisements. The ruling emphasizes that liability under consumer law must be anchored to statutory mandate and direct transactional involvement.</p>\n\n<p>The case stemmed from a complaint against actor Mohanlal, who was the brand ambassador for Manappuram Finance. Complainants, purportedly influenced by advertisements featuring Mohanlal, availed a gold loan but later alleged they were charged a higher interest rate than advertised. Consequently, they impleaded Mohanlal as an opposite party in their consumer complaint, attributing his involvement solely to his endorsement of the company. The District and State Consumer Commissions had previously upheld the maintainability of the complaint against him.</p>\n\n<p>The High Court overturned these decisions, asserting that a direct legal nexus between the endorser and the consumer transaction is crucial for imposing liability in cases of unfair trade practice or service deficiency. The court found no direct link between Mohanlal and the loan transaction, noting that assurances regarding interest rates were attributed to the finance company, not to the endorser's independent representations. It underscored that mere \"endorser\" status does not automatically create liability for service deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment further elucidated that Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, provides a specific, self-contained mechanism for addressing misleading advertisements, including provisions for due diligence defenses for endorsers. Therefore, liability for deficiency of service properly rests with the service provider. While the complaint against Mohanlal was deemed not maintainable, the complainants retain their remedies against the finance company and are at liberty to pursue claims concerning misleading advertisements under Section 21 before the competent authority. This ruling draws a clear doctrinal boundary, ensuring liability aligns with transactional involvement rather than mere association.</p>",

    "description": "<p>India's Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance laws) Bill, 2025, or \"Insurance 2.0 Framework,\" introduces comprehensive reforms to modernize the sector. This legislative intervention aims to achieve \"Insurance for all,\" boost capital availability, enhance regulatory efficiency, improve governance standards, and strengthen policyholder protection. The reforms seek to reposition India within the global insurance ecosystem by addressing structural constraints like foreign ownership limits and rigid transaction frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>Key reforms include increasing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Indian insurers to 100% from the previous 74%, designed to unlock foreign capital and scale operations. To attract global reinsurers, the net owned fund requirement for foreign reinsurance branches is significantly reduced to INR 1,000 crore. The Bill also streamlines corporate actions by raising the IRDAI approval threshold for share transfers from 1% to 5% and expands the Mergers & Amalgamations framework to allow non-insurance business integration, facilitating group restructuring.</p>\n\n<p>The framework lays the groundwork for composite insurance licenses, potentially allowing insurers to operate across life, health, and general segments, fostering diversification. Regulatory flexibility is enhanced, empowering IRDAI to prescribe general commission caps, replacing product-specific limits. The definition of \"insurance business\" is expanded to include value-added and ancillary services. Governance is strengthened by broadly prohibiting directors or officers from serving simultaneously in other insurers of the same class, banking, or investment companies, preventing conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>Policyholder protection is bolstered through enhanced data collection requirements and formal mechanisms for accessing policy and claims data with consent. The reforms formally recognize new intermediaries, such as Managing General Agents (MGAs) and insurance repositories, promoting specialized participation and niche product development. Operational efficiency is improved via one-time registration for intermediaries (replacing three-year renewals), formal recognition of online premium payments, and mandatory corporate naming conventions.</p>\n\n<p>These reforms signify a structural recalibration of India's insurance sector, combining market liberalization with strengthened regulatory oversight. Their successful implementation, dependent on clear and consistent regulations, is crucial for deepening insurance penetration, promoting sustainable growth, and reinforcing India's position as a competitive and well-regulated insurance market.</p>",

Union of India has fundamentally redefined Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in India, transforming it from a mechanism of voluntary welfare into a mandatory Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER). Delivered in response to the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB), this ruling establishes CSR as a constitutional and fiduciary obligation, integrating ecological preservation with corporate economic activities.</p>\n\n<p>The litigation stemmed from the precipitous decline of the GIB, primarily due to collisions with overhead power lines from energy projects. While an earlier interim order restricted such lines, the Union Government sought modification citing renewable energy commitments. The Court then appointed an Expert Committee, whose recommendations form the basis of this judgment.</p>\n\n<p>The Court's reasoning is rooted in constitutional duties (Articles 48A, 51A(g)), Companies Act provisions (Sections 135, 166), and environmental principles like Polluter Pays. It categorically states that corporate profit is partly owed to the society and environment enabling its generation, asserting that \"Social Responsibility\" must inherently include \"Environmental Responsibility.\" Directors' fiduciary duties now explicitly encompass environmental protection, shifting from shareholder primacy to a broader stakeholder view.</p>\n\n<p>The judgment approves revised GIB priority conservation areas (14,013 sq. km. in Rajasthan, 740 sq. km. in Gujarat). Within these zones, it prohibits new renewable energy projects and new overhead power transmission lines (except 11 KV and below). For existing high-voltage lines, it directs an action plan for undergrounding or installing bird diverters. It also mandates intensified in-situ conservation efforts, linking them directly to CSR funding. This ruling ensures that economic development respects ecological limits, positioning corporations as trustees of ecosystems and obligating them to constitutional stewardship, not merely charity.</p>",

Despite a surge in cases involving unauthorized use, deepfakes, and AI-generated content, India currently lacks a dedicated statutory framework, compelling affected individuals to rely on fragmented legal provisions.</p>\n\n<p>Indian courts have incrementally developed personality rights from constitutional principles, tort law, and intellectual property. Landmark judgments like Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India affirmed privacy as a fundamental right, laying the groundwork for identity control. Subsequent cases such as D.M. Entertainment and Titan Industries recognized the independent commercial value inherent in a celebrity's persona. Recent rulings involving Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have issued injunctions against the misuse of names, images, voices, and even mannerisms, particularly when enhanced by AI technologies. The Kamal Haasan case further introduced \"John Doe\" injunctions, offering pre-emptive protection against anticipated digital exploitation.</p>\n\n<p>However, judicial protection for personality rights has limits. The Siddiqua Begum Khan v. Union of India case (Shah Bano) unequivocally established that personality rights, including privacy and reputation, are personal to an individual and extinguish upon death. This ruling rejected posthumous claims by legal heirs, highlighting a distinct contrast with the robust protection afforded to living individuals.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, remedies against deepfakes and AI-driven identity misuse are piecemeal, drawing upon copyright law, trademark law, and select sections of the Information Technology Act, 2000, alongside administrative advisories from MeitY.

    "description": "<p>The Supreme Court of India, in Kanchana Rai v. Geeta Sharma & Uma Devi v. Geeta Sharma, has decisively ruled that a daughter-in-law widowed after her father-in-law's death is a \"dependant\" under Section 21(vii) of the Hindu Adoptions & Maintenance Act, 1956 (HAMA) and can claim maintenance from his estate under Section 22. This judgment, delivered by Justices Pankaj Mithal and S.V.N. Bhatti, effectively removes the temporal coincidence of widowhood as a precondition, reinforcing HAMA's overarching mission to protect vulnerable relatives.</p>\n\n<p>The case originated from the estate of Dr. Mahendra Prasad. His daughter-in-law, Geeta Sharma, became a widow after Dr. Prasad's demise and sought maintenance. The Family Court initially dismissed her petition, interpreting \"any widow of his son\" in Section 21(vii) narrowly to exclude widows whose husbands survived the father-in-law. The High Court reversed this, stating the expression was not temporally qualified. Appellants Kanchana Rai and Uma Devi argued for a narrower reading, citing testamentary freedom and contending that Section 19's personal obligation on the father-in-law extinguished upon his death.</p>\n\n<p>The Supreme Court affirmed the High Court's decision, emphasizing that the legislature's omission of \"predeceased\" in Section 21(vii) was deliberate. A restrictive interpretation, the Court reasoned, would violate Article 14 by creating an irrational classification lacking a rational nexus to the Act's protective objective and Article 21 by threatening the right to life with dignity. The Court stressed that social welfare legislation like HAMA prevails over testamentary autonomy, and Section 22 establishes an enduring charge on the estate, reflecting heirs' pious obligation to uphold the deceased's moral duties. The appeals were dismissed, reinstating the direction for the Family Court to quantify Geeta Sharma's maintenance, underscoring that wills cannot override the fundamental economic safety net guaranteed to statutory dependants.</p>",

Airports Authority of India, significantly reaffirmed the mandatory nature of Section 12(5) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. This judgment strictly prohibits unilateral arbitrator appointments by parties with a controlling interest, reinforcing the foundational principles of neutrality, independence, and equality in arbitral proceedings, consistent with post-2015 arbitration jurisprudence.</p>\n\n<p>The dispute arose from licence agreements where the Airports Authority of India (AAI) appointed a sole arbitrator, despite its Chairman (who made the appointment) falling under the Seventh Schedule's ineligibility criteria. The appellants, initially participating in proceedings, later challenged the appointment under Section 12(5) during Section 34 applications.</p>\n\n<p>The Court examined three critical issues: the arbitrator's ineligibility under Section 12(5), whether the appellants waived this right, and if the challenge was maintainable at the Section 34 stage. It held that Section 12(5), with its non-obstante clause, renders such unilateral appointments void ab initio, as the AAI Chairman was statutorily ineligible to appoint an arbitrator.</p>\n\n<p>Crucially, the Court ruled that waiver of Section 12(5) requires an \"express agreement in writing\" entered into after disputes have arisen. Mere participation, silence, or a \"no objection\" recorded in procedural orders is insufficient to waive this mandatory statutory protection. Furthermore, such fundamental ineligibility constitutes a de jure inability under Section 14(1)(a), meaning the challenge can be raised at any stage, including Section 34 proceedings, as it invalidates the entire arbitral process.</p>\n\n<p>By allowing the appeals and setting aside the award, the Supreme Court emphasized that party autonomy must yield to statutory safeguards ensuring fairness and eliminating perceived bias. This robust ruling fortifies the credibility of Indian arbitration, cautioning practitioners and contracting parties to ensure arbitration clauses and appointment mechanisms strictly adhere to statutory requirements to prevent the nullification of proceedings.</p>",

    "title": "From Choice To Compliance: Regulating Live-In Relationships In India\u2019s Emerging Legal Order",
    "description": "<p>Indian constitutional law previously treated live-in relationships as private matters, intervening only for protection, not permission, upholding adult autonomy under Article 21. Landmark judgments like Lata Singh and S Khushboo emphasized non-interference, refusing to criminalize cohabitation and warning against using criminal law for social morality. Legal protections, such as those \"in the nature of marriage,\" were welfare-driven, triggered by vulnerability, and did not mandate registration. This approach reflected a deliberate constitutional design focused on liberty through non-intervention.</p>\n\n<p>However, this judicial settlement is unravelling, marking a decisive shift towards state regulation. Uttarakhand\u2019s Uniform Civil Code (2025) transforms live-in relationships into registrable legal events, requiring couples to notify the State, disclose personal details, and formally record termination, with criminal penalties for non-compliance. Justified as protection, this regime preemptively presumes risk, acting as a licensing mechanism for intimacy. This contravenes the Puttaswamy judgment's emphasis on decisional autonomy and proportionality; a right conditioned on disclosure becomes permission, not an inherent liberty.</p>\n\n<p>Further, Section 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 criminalizes sexual relations obtained by \"deceitful means,\" specifically including unfulfilled promises of marriage. This provision risks conflating emotional uncertainty with dishonest intent at a relationship's inception, a distinction Indian courts previously maintained. It invites retrospective reconstruction of intent, potentially converting private relational history and relationship breakdowns into penal liability, a task for which criminal law is ill-suited due to its demand for certainty.</p>\n\n<p>Ironically, existing welfare mechanisms like maintenance and domestic violence remedies continue to operate without requiring registration or criminal complaints, creating a \"constitutional schizophrenia\" where the State simultaneously trusts and distrusts adults. This emerging framework, though framed as protective, revives moral governance through bureaucratic and criminal means. It replaces autonomy with audit, recasts relational uncertainty as criminal deceit, and risks transforming personal failure into penal liability. This shift raises fundamental questions about privacy, proportionality, and the constitutional limits of state power, signaling that constitutional liberty might be quietly rewritten if intimacy requires declaration for protection and choice must be justified to avoid punishment.</p>",

    "title": "The Inalienability Of Ownership: A Jurisprudential Analysis Of Tenancy And Title Preservation In India",
    "description": "<p>Indian property law definitively establishes that long-term possession, such as tenancy, does not automatically confer ownership rights. This fundamental principle is upheld by the Transfer of Property Act (TPA) 1882, the Indian Evidence Act 1872, and consistent Supreme Court rulings. Ownership, defined as an exhaustive \"bundle of rights\" including disposal, is distinct from a lease, which merely grants a limited \"right to enjoy\" the property. Even a perpetual lease does not transfer absolute title, and tenants are legally obligated to return the property to the landlord.</p>\n\n<p>A crucial legal barrier to tenants claiming ownership is the doctrine of estoppel, codified in Section 116 of the Indian Evidence Act. This prevents tenants from denying their landlord's title during the tenancy. The maxim \"Once a tenant, always a tenant\" signifies that a tenant's status remains unchanged by the passage of time or non-payment of rent, unless legally altered by a new contract.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the doctrine of adverse possession, which requires \"hostile, open, and continuous\" occupation for 12 years, does not apply to tenants, as their possession is \"permissive,\" not hostile. Recent Supreme Court judgments, including Jyoti Sharma v. Vishnu Goyal (2025), have unequivocally reaffirmed that decades of occupation do not convert tenancy into ownership, upholding the \"cardinal estoppel.\"</p>\n\n<p>While state Rent Control Acts provide statutory protections to tenants, these confer personal rights to occupy, not proprietary interests.
