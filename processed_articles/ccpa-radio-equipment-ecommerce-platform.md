# CCPA Issues Guidelines to Regulate Radio Equipment Sales on E-Commerce Platforms

The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has introduced new guidelines, "Guidelines for the Prevention and Regulation of Illegal Listing and Sale of Radio Equipment including Walkie-Talkies on E-Commerce Platforms, 2025," to regulate the sale of radio equipment, including walkie-talkies, on e-commerce platforms. These guidelines, issued under Section 18 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, aim to ensure compliance with national telecommunications and security regulations. They apply to all e-commerce platforms operating in or catering to India, as well as manufacturers, importers, and sellers of radio equipment, including devices requiring specific authorization from the Department of Telecommunications (DOT).

The guidelines mandate that radio equipment requiring frequency assignment from DOT can only be sold if purchased from an authorized dealer. E-commerce platforms must not list or sell mobile signal boosters or wireless jammers. Product listings must specify frequency ranges, technical parameters, and regulatory approval details like Equipment Type Approval (ETA). Platforms are required to implement automated scanning systems for non-compliant listings and provide a user-friendly reporting mechanism.

E-commerce platforms are responsible for ensuring the authenticity of test reports for license-exempt equipment and removing non-compliant listings within 24 hours of receiving directions from the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) or DOT. They must also cooperate with regulators for real-time takedowns, enforcement actions, and submit regular audits and compliance reports. Non-compliance will result in penalties under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, potential blacklisting, and additional penalties from DoT. Platforms are also required to display notices educating consumers on the risks of purchasing unauthorized devices.
