# CDSCO Clarifies Permission for Overprinting/Stickering of Imported Drugs Under Rule 104A

The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), under the Directorate General of Health Services, issued an Office Memorandum on May 26, 2025, to clarify the comprehensive permission process for importing drugs intended for labeling, overprinting, and stickering under Rule 104A of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945. This memorandum supplements a previous directive from January 29, 2020, focusing on specific requirements and conditions for these activities.

Rule 104A generally prohibits alterations to drug labels unless authorized by the Licensing Authority. The memorandum clarifies the permissible conditions for these alterations, especially concerning imported drugs. It specifies that only importers holding a valid manufacturing license can conduct labeling, overprinting, or stickering.

Licensees must maintain adequate facilities for storage, ancillary activities, and labeling and appoint at least one manufacturing and QA personnel member, to the satisfaction of the SLA. While a QC Laboratory and personnel may not be necessary, adherence to all other relevant provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules is mandatory. Critically, the original label must remain visible, and the license number along with a description of the activity performed must be clearly displayed on the label. An example provided illustrates the labeling requirement for CGHS supply drugs, which must include the phrase "CGHS Supply Overprint." This clarification aims to ensure regulatory compliance and facilitate the import of drugs with specific labeling needs.
