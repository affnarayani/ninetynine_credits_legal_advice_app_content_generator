# Delhi High Court Terminates Arbitrator's Mandate Due to Unexplained Delay

The Delhi High Court recently terminated the mandate of a Sole Arbitrator in the case of *Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited vs Sopan Projects* due to an unexplained delay of over three years in delivering the arbitral award after final arguments were concluded. The Court emphasized the significance of timely dispute resolution within arbitration proceedings and reinforced its dedication to upholding the principles enshrined in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

The dispute stemmed from a Work Order issued by Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited to Sopan Projects for the construction of an underground MDPE pipeline. Following disputes arising from the alleged abandonment of work by Sopan Projects, arbitration was invoked. While final arguments concluded in March 2020, the arbitrator failed to render an award, prompting Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited to petition for termination of the arbitrator's mandate under Section 14 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

The Petitioner argued the delay was inordinate and contrary to public policy, while the Respondent cited unpaid fees and sought exclusion of the Suo Moto Writ Petition period from the delay calculation. The Court, referencing Section 14 of the Act and Supreme Court judgments emphasizing speedy arbitration, found the unexplained delay sufficient grounds for termination. The Court concluded that the delay undermined the purpose of arbitration and went against the public policy of India.
