# India Imposes Ban on Import and Transit of Goods from Pakistan

On May 2nd, 2025, India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, issued Notification 06/2025-26, effectively prohibiting the import and transit of all goods originating in or exported from Pakistan. This action, immediately effective, implements Paragraph 2.20A of the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023.

The notification, published in the Gazette of India, is grounded in the Foreign Trade (Development & Regulation) Act, 1992, and the FTP 2023. These provisions empower the government to regulate trade activities posing threats to national interests. The comprehensive ban applies to all goods, with potential exceptions requiring prior approval from the Government of India.

This prohibition signifies a considerable shift in trade relations between India and Pakistan, with potential economic impacts requiring businesses to seek alternative import sources and prompting a re-evaluation of trade policies. The government emphasizes national security and public policy as the rationale for this decisive measure, indicating its commitment to safeguarding national interests through trade regulation.
