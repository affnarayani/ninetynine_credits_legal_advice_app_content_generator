# Environmental Impact of Pharmaceutical Waste: Review of CDSCO Guidance Document on Disposal of Expired/Unused Drugs

The Director General of Health Services, CDSCO, issued a guidance document on May 26, 2025, outlining safe and responsible disposal methods for expired and unused medicines. This initiative addresses the ecological risks highlighted by researchers and discussed by the Drugs Consultative Committee (DCC), emphasizing the need to protect human health and the environment.

The guidance document aims to provide clear instructions for compliance with the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and Rules, to minimize environmental impact, public health risks, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Improper disposal can lead to water contamination, drug misuse, and adverse drug reactions from degraded medicines.

The document outlines disposal methods such as landfill (in properly engineered sites), waste immobilization (encapsulation and inertization), and sewer disposal for specific liquid pharmaceuticals. It discourages open burning due to air pollution and recommends incineration for certain waste types, with chemical decomposition as an alternative if incineration is unavailable. It also references existing rules for disposal at various levels, aligning with the Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016.

Detailed procedures are provided for retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, hospitals, and government agencies, requiring them to return or properly dispose of expired/unused drugs while maintaining detailed records. It also covers collection, storage, and transportation of expired/unused drugs, specifying the use of yellow non-chlorinated bags/containers and outlining specific handling procedures for cytotoxic, radioactive, and controlled substances.

For the general public, the document suggests establishing "Drug take back" sites and provides a list of medications that can be safely flushed to prevent accidental ingestion or misuse. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for all stakeholders to mitigate environmental impact and public health risks associated with improper pharmaceutical waste disposal.
