# Karnataka Enacts Groundbreaking Ordinance For Gig Worker Welfare

The Government of Karnataka has introduced the Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Ordinance, 2025, a landmark policy designed to protect gig workers and regulate digital platforms operating within the state. This ordinance establishes a legal framework for social security, occupational health and safety, transparency in automated monitoring, and dispute resolution for gig workers.

The ordinance applies to all aggregators and platforms offering services within Karnataka, defining a gig worker as someone performing work based on a contract with a specified rate of payment, typically through a digital platform. Social security benefits encompassed include healthcare access and income support during periods of unemployment, old age, illness, maternity, or disability, funded by a welfare fee ranging from 1% to 5% of a workerâ€™s payout, levied on platforms.

A dedicated Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers Welfare Board will be established to administer the ordinance, composed of government officials, representatives of gig workers and aggregators, civil society members, and technical experts. Platforms are required to register with the Board, offer fair contracts with clear terms, and ensure transparency in algorithmic practices affecting assignments and earnings, while also providing human points of contact for worker queries.

The ordinance creates a Karnataka Gig Workers Social Security and Welfare Fund, financed through welfare fees, voluntary contributions, and government grants. Financial transactions will be audited annually, with a Payment and Welfare Fee Verification System (PWFVS) implemented to monitor payouts. Non-compliance will result in penalties, and the State Government is authorized to issue rules for enforcing the ordinance. Karnataka sets a national precedent for gig worker protection with this legislation, offering a model for other states and the central government to follow.
