# FSSAI Advisory: Discontinuation of the Term “100%” on Food Product Labels and Promotional Materials

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued an advisory on May 28, 2025, addressing the potentially misleading use of the term “100%” on food product labels and promotional materials. This action aims to ensure compliance with existing regulations and protect consumers from deceptive marketing practices.

The FSSAI has observed a rise in the use of "100%" on food products, which they consider ambiguous and capable of falsely conveying absolute purity or superiority. This can mislead consumers into thinking competing products don't meet required standards.

The advisory, issued under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, references the Food Safety and Standards (Advertising and Claims) Regulations, 2018, which prohibits misleading advertisements and claims. Specifically, the regulations mandate that claims must be truthful, unambiguous, and not misleading to ensure consumer comprehension.

The FSSAI advises all Food Business Operators (FBOs) to discontinue using the term "100%" on food product labels, packaging, and promotional content, as it lacks definition in the FSS Act, 2006, and its associated regulations, potentially causing consumer confusion. This initiative reinforces transparency and accuracy in marketing practices within the food industry, maintaining high standards of food safety and consumer protection. FBOs are urged to comply with the advisory to avoid regulatory violations and uphold product and marketing integrity.
