# FSSAI Issues Guidelines for Acceptance of Recycled PET as Food Contact Material

On May 23, 2025, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued guidelines for the acceptance of recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) as Food Contact Material (FCM), under the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging) Regulations, 2018. These guidelines aim to establish stringent safety and quality standards for recycled PET used in food packaging, focusing on the recycling process of post-consumer PET into FCM-rPET.

The notification provides definitions for key terms such as "Food Authority," "manufacturer," and relevant materials like virgin PET (vPET), Post-Consumer Food Grade PET, and FCM-rPET. The guidelines mandate rigorous testing procedures, including Challenge, Extraction, and Migration Tests, to be conducted in accredited labs to ensure the safety of recycled PET.

Detailed process requirements are specified to maintain the purity and safety of recycled PET, including minimum quality standards, process validation criteria, and ongoing monitoring programs. The guidelines outline stringent acceptance criteria for FCM-rPET resin to guarantee its suitability for food contact applications. Materials made from FCM-rPET resin must be marked and labelled with a specific symbol indicating the percentage of recycled resin used, and comply with other national requirements.

Manufacturers, converters, beverage bottlers, food packers, and Food Business Operators (FBOs) are required to maintain comprehensive documentation, including a Declaration of Compliance, a Regulatory Opinion, and supply chain records. Manufacturers must apply for authorization by submitting necessary information, and will be subject to annual audits. The Food Authority will authorize or reject applications based on assessment, register authorized manufacturers on the FSSAI website, and reserves the right to request additional information. Authorization is contingent upon compliance with FSSAI criteria and regulations, and maintenance of all specified documents, records, and test reports.

In conclusion, FSSAI's notification is a significant measure to ensure the safety and quality of food packaging materials, promoting sustainable practices while safeguarding public health through comprehensive guidelines for the use of recycled PET in food contact applications.
