# High Court of Punjab and Haryana: Proportionality in Punishment is Key in Disciplinary Actions

The High Court of Punjab and Haryana has ruled in the case of Satyaveer Singh vs State of Haryana and others, emphasizing the importance of proportionality in disciplinary actions. The court reduced the punishment of a police officer who was penalized for a single day's absence from duty, highlighting the need for punishments to be commensurate with the offenses committed.

The petitioner, Satyaveer Singh, a constable in the Haryana Police Force, was initially dismissed for being absent from duty for 24 hours and 20 minutes. This dismissal was later reduced to the forfeiture of 10 annual increments with permanent effect by the appellate authority. The petitioner then filed a revision before the Director General of Police, Haryana, which was dismissed. He then filed a writ petition arguing that the punishment was disproportionate to the misconduct. The respondent, represented by the Additional Advocate General, Haryana, conceded that the punishment was for a single day's absence but emphasized the need for discipline in the police force.

Relying on Rule 16.2 of the Punjab Police Rules, 1934, and Supreme Court judgments like Om Kumar v. Union of India and Bhagat Ram v. State of Himachal Pradesh, the High Court stressed that dismissal is reserved for the gravest misconduct and that disproportionate punishment violates Article 14 of the Constitution. The court found the forfeiture of 10 annual increments to be disproportionate to a single day's absence, noting that the appellate and revisionary authorities had acted mechanically. To avoid further litigation after 10 years, the court reduced the punishment to forfeiture of one increment with cumulative effect. This decision underscores the court's commitment to proportionate punishment in disciplinary actions.
